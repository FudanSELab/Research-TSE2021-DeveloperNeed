Instead, they claim, a lock on a private reference is to be preferred. Some of the given reasons are: some evil code may steal your lock (very popular this one, also has an \"accidentally\" variant) all synchronized methods within the same class use the exact same lock, which reduces throughput you are (unnecessarily) exposing too much information Other people, including me, argue that synchronized(this) is an idiom that is used a lot (also in Java libraries), is safe and well understood. It should not be avoided because you have a bug and you don't have a clue of what is going on in your multithreaded program. In other words: if it is applicable, then use it. I am interested in seeing some real-world examples (no foobar stuff) where avoiding a lock on this is preferable when synchronized(this) would also do the job. Therefore: should you always avoid synchronized(this) and replace it with a lock on a private reference? Some further info (updated as answers are given): we are talking about instance synchronization both implicit (synchronized methods) and explicit form of synchronized(this) are considered if you quote Bloch or other authorities on the subject, don't leave out the parts you don't like (e.g. Effective Java, item on Thread Safety: Typically it is the lock on the instance itself, but there are exceptions.) if you need granularity in your locking other than synchronized(this) provides, then synchronized(this) is not applicable so that's not the issue"

When running this code in Java 10, we get the following result: -CODE- . The numbering is entirely off using Java 10. So what is happening here? Is it a bug in Java 10? Follow ups from the comments: The issue appears when compiled with Java 9 or later (we found it in Java 10). Compiling this code on Java 8, then running in Java 9 or any later version, including Java 11 early access, gives the expected result. This kind of code is non-standard, but is valid according to the spec. It was found by Kevin Cruijssen in a discussion in a golfing challenge, hence the weird use case encountered. Didier L found out that the issue can be reproduced with the much smaller and more understandable code: -CODE- . Result when compiled in Java 8: -CODE- . Result when compiled in Java 9 and 10: -CODE- . The issue seems to be limited to the string concatenation and assignment operator (+=) with an expression with side effect(s) as the left operand, like in array[test()]+=\"a\", array[ix++]+=\"a\", test()[index]+=\"a\", or test().field+=\"a\". To enable string concatenation, at least one of the sides must have type String. Trying to reproduce this on other types or constructs failed."

How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time? Here's a picture of what a list with a loop looks like:"

Related to: repeat string javascript Create NSString by repeating another string a given number of times Edited I try to avoid for loops when they are not completely necessary because: They add to the number of lines of code even if they are tucked away in another function. Someone reading my code has to figure out what I am doing in that for loop. Even if it is commented and has meaningful variables names, they still have to make sure it is not doing anything \"clever\". Programmers love to put clever things in for loops, even if I write it to \"only do what it is intended to do\", that does not preclude someone coming along and adding some additional clever \"fix\". They are very often easy to get wrong. For loops involving indexes tend to generate off by one bugs. For loops often reuse the same variables, increasing the chance of really hard to find scoping bugs. For loops increase the number of places a bug hunter has to look."

        "body": "I'm writing some code in Java where, at some point, the flow of the program is determined by whether two int variables, \"a\" and \"b\", are non-zero (note: a and b are never negative, and never within integer overflow range). I can evaluate it with -CODE- . Or alternatively -CODE- . Because I expect that piece of code to run millions of times per run, I was wondering which one would be faster. I did the experiment by comparing them on a huge randomly generated array, and I was also curious to see how the sparsity of the array (fraction of data = 0) would affect the results: -CODE- . And the results show that if you expect \"a\" or \"b\" to be equal to 0 more than ~3% of the time, a*b != 0 is faster than a!=0 && b!=0: I'm curious to know why. Could anyone shed some light? Is it the compiler or is it at the hardware level? Edit: Out of curiosity... now that I learned about branch prediction, I was wondering what the analog comparison would show for a OR b is non-zero: We do see the same effect of branch prediction as expected, interestingly the graph is somewhat flipped along the X-axis. Update 1- I added !(a==0 || b==0) to the analysis to see what happens. 2- I also included a != 0 || b != 0, (a+b) != 0 and (a|b) != 0 out of curiosity, after learning about branch prediction. But they are not logically equivalent to the other expressions, because only a OR b needs to be non-zero to return true, so they are not meant to be compared for processing efficiency. 3- I also added the actual benchmark that I used for the analysis, which is just iterating an arbitrary int variable. 4- Some people were suggesting to include a != 0 & b != 0 as opposed to a != 0 && b != 0, with the prediction that it would behave more closely to a*b != 0 because we would remove the branch prediction effect. I didn't know that & could be used with boolean variables, I thought it was only used for binary operations with integers. Note: In the context that I was considering all this, int overflow is not an issue, but that's definitely an important consideration in general contexts.

Answer Thanks to JuanZe's comment, I found the Joda-Time magic, it is also described here. So, the solution is -CODE- . Or more simply, use the default parser via the constructor: -CODE- . To me, this is nice."

An example might be if I have a concurrency test that needs to be run on a machine with a certain number of cores. If this test were run on a uniprocessor machine, I don't think it would be correct to just pass the test (since it hasn't been run), and it certainly wouldn't be right to fail the test and break the build. So I want to be able to ignore tests at runtime, as this seems like the right outcome (since the test framework will allow the build to pass but record that the tests weren't run). I'm fairly sure that the annotation won't give me this flexibility, and suspect that I'll need to manually create the test suite for the class in question. However, the documentation doesn't mention anything about this and looking through the API it's also not clear how this would be done programmatically (i.e. how do I programatically create an instance of Test or similar that is equivalent to that created by the @Ignore annotation?). If anyone has done something similar in the past, or has a bright idea of how else I could go about this, I'd be happy to hear about it."

I don't see any alternative to their use when I want to define proportions between displayed components. I have been told this: -CODE- . I have searched the web a little bit, but I haven't found any comprehensive analysis of the subject. So I have the following questions: Should I completely avoid the use of those methods? The methods have been defined for a reason. So when should I use them? In which context? For what purposes? What exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution). I don't think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ? If the answer to 4 is \"yes\", won't this lead to a proliferation of LayoutManager classes which will become difficult to maintain? In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?"

Why do people do this? -CODE- . Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner better? Why bubble up?

In this case, I think it should just call an empty method (i.e. {}). All subclasses would be forced to implement the static method, so they'd all be fine when calling the static method. So why isn't this possible? EDIT: I guess I'm looking for answer that's deeper than \"because that's the way Java is\". Is there a particular technological reason why static methods can't be overwritten? That is, why did the designers of Java decide to make instance methods overrideable but not static methods? EDIT: The problem with my design is I'm trying to use interfaces to enforce a coding convention. That is, the goal of the interface is twofold: I want the IXMLizable interface to allow me to convert classes that implement it to XML elements (using polymorphism, works fine). If someone wants to make a new instance of a class that implements the IXMLizable interface, they will always know that there will be a newInstanceFromXML(Element e) static constructor. Is there any other way to ensure this, other than just putting a comment in the interface? EDIT: As of Java 8, static methods are now allowed in interfaces."

To make my question more specific, I am writing an application that deals with data and the specification say that there should be a 'reset' button that brings the application back to its original just launched state. However, all data have to be 'live' unless the application is closed or reset button is pressed. Being usually a C/C++ programmer, I thought this would be trivial to implement. (And hence I planned to implement it last.) I structured my program such that all the 'reset-able' objects would be in the same class so that I can just destroy all 'live' objects when a reset button is pressed. I was thinking if all I did was just to dereference the data and wait for the garbage collector to collect them, wouldn't there be a memory leak if my user repeatedly entered data and pressed the reset button? I was also thinking since Java is quite mature as a language, there should be a way to prevent this from happening or gracefully tackle this."

Now, you might argue that you could always pick a most descriptive name for the user implementation and the problem goes away, but Java's pushing a POJO approach to things and most IOC containers use DynamicProxies extensively. These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation.

Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about 231.5 integers whose square is less than 263). Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now: -CODE- . Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems. So no one else will ever have to maintain this code. And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems. I've tried the different solutions to the problem: After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine. The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881. However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n < 410881. Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt(). This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java. Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles. A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt(). Binary chop was even slower. This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number. According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch. I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values). Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&0x3F)]) { test } else return false;. To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java."

This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations. I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes. I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method: -CODE- . returns: -CODE- . which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: -CODE- . returns: -CODE- . Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter: -CODE- . returns: -CODE- . However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this: -CODE- . What is the best way to achieve this in Java?"

Hibernate doesn't like two collections with FetchType.EAGER, but this seems to be a bug, I'm not doing unusual things... Removing FetchType.EAGER from Parent or AnotherParent solves the problem, but I need it, so real solution is to use @LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.FALSE) instead of FetchType (thanks to Bozho for the solution)."

Apparently, one could use the command line to pass arguments to the JVM for Increasing the heap size, via \"-Xmx1024m\" (or more), or Disabling the error check altogether, via \"-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit\". The first approach works fine, the second ends up in another java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, this time about the heap. So, question: is there any programmatic alternative to this, for the particular use case (i.e., several small HashMap objects)? If I use the HashMap clear() method, for instance, the problem goes away, but so do the data stored in the HashMap! :-) The issue is also discussed in a related topic in StackOverflow."

I have the below entry in server.xml of both Tomcats: -CODE- . Every site says the same reason that certificate given by app2 is not in the trusted store of app1 jvm. This seems to be true also when I tried to hit the same URL in IE browser, it works (with warming, There is a problem with this web site's security certificate. Here I say continue to this website). But when same URL is hit by Java client (in my case) I get the above error. So to put it in the truststore I tried these three options: Option1 -CODE- . Option2 Setting below in environment variable -CODE- . Option3 Setting below in environment variable -CODE- . But nothing worked . What at last worked is executing the Java approach suggested in How to handle invalid SSL certificates with Apache HttpClient? by Pascal Thivent i.e. executing the program InstallCert. But this approach is fine for devbox setup but I can not use it at production environment. I am wondering why three approaches mentioned above did not work when I have mentioned the same values in server.xml of app2 server and same values in truststore by setting System.setProperty(\"javax.net.ssl.trustStore\", \"C:/.keystore\") and System.setProperty(\"javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword\", \"changeit\"); in app1 program.

Edit: Two answers say StringBuilder.append() is preferable to the plus notation. Could anyone elaborate as to why they think so? It doesn't look more preferable to me at all. I'm looking for a way around the fact that multiline strings are not a first-class language construct, which means I definitely don't want to replace a first-class language construct (string concatenation with plus) with method calls.

I should mention I'm completely new to Java. JSP files seem to make it easy to work with common includes and variables, much like PHP, but I'd like to know a simple way to get something like template inheritance (Django style) or at least be able to have a base.jsp file containing the header and the footer, so I can insert content later. Ben Lings seems to offer some hope in his answer here: JSP template inheritance Can someone explain how to achieve this? Given that I don't have much time I think dynamic routing is a little much, so I'm happy to just to have URLs map directly onto .jsp files, but I'm open to suggestion. Thanks. edit: I don't want to use any external libraries, because it would increase the learning curve for myself and others who work on the project, and the company I work for has been contracted to do this. Another edit: I'm not sure if JSP tags will be useful because my content doesn't really have any template variables. What I need is a way to be able to do this: base.html: -CODE- . somepage.html -CODE- . with the output being: -CODE- . I think this would give me enough versatility to do everything I need. It could be achieved with includes but then I would need a top and a bottom include for each wrapper, which is kind of messy."

        "title": "How slow are Java exceptions?",
        "body": "Question: Is exception handling in Java actually slow? Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java. Two reasons are usually given, it is really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary), and it is messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code. This question is about #1. As an example, this page describes Java exception handling as \"very slow\" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - \"this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast.\" The article Effective Exception Handling in Java says that \"the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow\". Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down. My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code. I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code. At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to return or throw. This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up. In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster). I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of the code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow. What leads me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic. I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to. Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking? In the paper Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down. I haven't tested this theory yet."

I suspect that repeated variable declaration (example b) creates more overhead in theory, but that compilers are smart enough so that it doesn't matter. Example b has the advantage of being more compact and limiting the scope of the variable to where it is used. Still, I tend to code according example a.

I do catch JsonParseExceptions and \"result\" is not null. I checked listType with the debugger and got the following: list Type args = ListOfTypes list = null resolvedTypes = Type[ 1 ] loader = PathClassLoader ownerType0 = null ownerTypeRes = null rawType = Class (java.util.ArrayList) rawTypeName = \"java.util.ArrayList\" so it seems the \"getClass\" invocation didn't work properly. Any suggestions...? Edit2: I'v checked on the Gson User Guide. It mentions a Runtime Exception that should happen during parsing a generic type to Json. I did it \"wrong\" (not shown above), just as in the example, but didn't get that exception at all. So I changed the serialization as in the user guide suggested. Didn't help, though.

I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file. The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run. I then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows. -CODE- . Maven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository. I then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents). Finally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency). -CODE- . I now create a new class as follows: -CODE- . Now for the weirdness. IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine. However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: \"Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'\", BUT Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too). So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem. I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine. F12 (\"Go To Declaration\") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports. Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the \"Projects\" window the \"com.hunnysoft.jmime\" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under \"Libraries\". Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks. It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK). As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries. I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project. Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file. -CODE- . I don't see anything unusual in this jar file. My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue. But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing). So, anyone have any IDEAs?"

I've broken the SQL statements semantically into several concatenated strings over several lines of code for ease of maintenance. So instead of something like: -CODE- . I have something like: -CODE- . This style makes the SQL much easier to read and maintain (IMHO), especially for larger queries. For example, I can put my editor into \"overwrite\" mode and modify the text in-place fairly easily. Note that this issue generalizes beyond the particular example of SQL. Any code that is written with any vertical formatting, particularly tabular constructs, is susceptible to destruction by a pretty printer. Now, some project members use the Eclipse editor and the semantic formatting is often destroyed when they format an entire source file. Is there a way to instruct Eclipse to ignore certain lines of source with respect to formatting? I'm looking for something like a special comment that toggles the Eclipse formatter. Ideally, such a comment could be configurable to be whatever we choose, and other formatters could be programmed to respect it as well: -CODE- . Obviously, one \"solution\" is to have our team members standardize on some external formatter like Jalopy or JIndent, but that's not what this question is about (also, not my decision on this project): I'm specifically looking for a way to avoid the Eclipse formatter on an ad-hoc basis. Ideally, a solution will allow me to insert instructions for the Eclipse formatter without requiring team members using Eclipse to do any IDE reconfiguration (other than possibly choosing a formatter agnostic command comment: STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING \u2192 STOP-FORMATTING)."

        "body": "For the first time in my life I find myself in a position where I'm writing a Java API that will be open sourced. Hopefully to be included in many other projects. For logging I (and indeed the people I work with) have always used JUL (java.util.logging) and never had any issues with it. However now I need to understand in more detail what I should do for my API development. I've done some research on this and with the information I've got I just get more confused. Hence this post. Since I come from JUL I'm biased on that. My knowledge of the rest is not that big. From the research I've done I've come up with these reasons why people do not like JUL: \"I started developing in Java long before Sun released JUL and it was just easier for me to continue with logging-framework-X rather than to learn something new\". Hmm. I'm not kidding, this is actually what people say. With this argument we could all be doing COBOL. (however I can certainly relate to this being a lazy dude myself) \"I don't like the names of the logging levels in JUL\". Ok, seriously, this is just not enough of a reason to introduce a new dependency. \"I don't like the standard format of the output from JUL\". Hmm. This is just configuration. You do not even have to do anything code-wise. (true, back in old days you may have had to create your own Formatter class to get it right). \"I use other libraries that also use logging-framework-X so I thought it easier just to use that one\". This is a cyclic argument, isn't ? Why does 'everybody' use logging-framework-X and not JUL? \"Everybody else is using logging-framework-X\". This to me is just a special case of the above. Majority is not always right. So the real big question is why not JUL?. What is it I have missed ? The raison d'\u00eatre for logging facades (SLF4J, JCL) is that multiple logging implementations have existed historically and the reason for that really goes back to the era before JUL as I see it. If JUL was perfect then logging facades wouldn't exist, or what? Rather than embracing them shouldn't we question why they were necessary in the first place? (and see if those reasons still exist) Ok, my research so far has led to a couple of things that I can see may be real issues with JUL: Performance. Some say that performance in SLF4J is superior to the rest. This seems to me to be a case of premature optimization. If you need to log hundreds of megabytes per second then I'm not sure you are on the right path anyway. JUL has also evolved and the tests you did on Java 1.4 may no longer be true. You can read about it here and this fix has made it into Java 7. Many also talk about the overhead of string concatenation in logging methods. However template based logging avoids this cost and it exist also in JUL. Personally I never really write template based logging. Too lazy for that. For example if I do this with JUL: -CODE- . my IDE will warn me and ask permission that it should change it to: -CODE- . .. which I will of course accept. Permission granted ! Thank you for your help. So I don't actually write such statements myself, that is done by the IDE. In conclusion on the issue of performance I haven't found anything that would suggest that JUL's performance is not ok compared to the competition. Configuration from classpath. Out-of-the-box JUL cannot load a configuration file from the classpath. It is a few lines of code to make it do so. I can see why this may be annoying but the solution is short and simple. Availability of output handlers. JUL comes with 5 output handlers out-of-the-box: console, file stream, socket and memory. These can be extended or new ones can be written. This may for example be writing to UNIX/Linux Syslog and Windows Event Log. I have personally never had this requirement nor have I seen it used but I can certainly relate to why it may be a useful feature. Logback comes with an appender for Syslog for example. Still I would argue that 99.5% of the needs for output destinations are covered by what is in JUL out-of-the-box. Special needs could be catered for by custom handlers on top of JUL rather than on top of something else. There's nothing to me that suggests that it takes more time to write a Syslog output handler for JUL than it does for another logging framework. I'm really concerned that there's something I've overlooked. The use of logging facades and logging implementations other than JUL is so widespread that I have to come to the conclusion that it's me who just doesn't understand. That wouldn't be the first time, I'm afraid. :-) So what should I do with my API? I want it to become successful. I can of course just \"go with the flow\" and implement SLF4J (which seems the most popular these days) but for my own sake I still need to understand exactly what is wrong with the JUL of today that warrants all the fuzz? Will I sabotage myself by choosing JUL for my library ? Testing performance (section added by nolan600 on 07-JUL-2012) There's a reference below from Ceki about SLF4J's parametrization being 10 times or more faster than JUL's. So I've started doing some simple tests. At first glance the claim is certainly correct. Here are the preliminary results (but read on!): Execution time SLF4J, backend Logback: 1515 Execution time SLF4J, backend JUL: 12938 Execution time JUL: 16911 The numbers above are msecs so less is better. So 10 times performance difference is by first actually pretty close. My initial reaction: That is a lot ! Here is the core of the test. As can be seen an integer and a string is construted in a loop which is then used in the log statement: -CODE- . (I wanted the log statement to have both a primitive data type (in this case an int) and a more complex data type (in this case a String). Not sure it matters but there you have it.) The log statement for SLF4J: -CODE- . The log statement for JUL: -CODE- . The JVM was 'warmed up' with the same test executed once before the actual measurement was done. Java 1.7.03 was used on Windows 7. Latest versions of SLF4J (v1.6.6) and Logback (v1.0.6) was used. Stdout and stderr was redirected to null device. However, careful now, it turns out JUL is spending most of its time in getSourceClassName() because JUL by default prints the source class name in the output, while Logback doesn't. So we are comparing apples and oranges. I have to do the test again and configure the logging implementations in a similar manner so that they actually output the same stuff. I do however suspect that SLF4J+Logback will still come out on top but far from the initial numbers as given above. Stay tuned. Btw: The test was first time I've actually worked with SLF4J or Logback. A pleasant experience. JUL is certainly a lot less welcoming when you are starting out. Testing performance (part 2) (section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012) As it turns out it doesn't really matter for performance how you configure your pattern in JUL, i.e. whether or not it includes the source name or not. I tried with a very simple pattern: -CODE- . and that did not change the above timings at all. My profiler revealed that the logger still spent a lot of time in calls to getSourceClassName() even if this was not part of my pattern. The pattern doesn't matter. I'm therefore concluding on the issue of performance that at least for the tested template based log statement there seems to be roughly a factor of 10 in real performance difference between JUL (slow) and SLF4J+Logback (quick). Just like Ceki said. I can also see another thing namely that SLF4J's getLogger() call is a lot more expensive than JUL's ditto. (95 ms vs 0.3 ms if my profiler is accurate). This makes sense. SLF4J has to do some time on the binding of the underlying logging implementation. This doesn't scare me. These calls should be somewhat rare in the lifetime of an application. The fastness should be in the actual log calls. Final conclusion (section added by nolan600 on 08-JUL-2012) Thank you for all your answers. Contrary to what I initially thought I've ended up deciding to use SLF4J for my API. This is based on a number of things and your input: It gives flexibility to choose log implementation at deployment time. Issues with lack of flexibility of JUL's configuration when run inside an application server. SLF4J is certainly a lot faster as detailed above in particular if you couple it with Logback. Even if this was just a rough test I have reason to believe that a lot more effort has gone into optimization on SLF4J+Logback than on JUL. Documentation. The documentation for SLF4J is simply a lot more comprehensive and precise. Pattern flexibility. As I did the tests I set out to have JUL mimic the default pattern from Logback. This pattern includes the name of the thread. It turns out JUL cannot do this out of the box. Ok, I haven't missed it until now, but I don't think it is a thing that should be missing from a log framework. Period! Most (or many) Java projects today use Maven so adding a dependency is not that big a thing especially if that dependency is rather stable, i.e. doesn't constantly change its API. This seems to be true for SLF4J. Also the SLF4J jar and friends are small in size. So the strange thing that happened was that I actually got quite upset with JUL after having worked a bit with SLF4J. I still regret that it has to be this way with JUL. JUL is far from perfect but kind of does the job. Just not quite well enough. The same can be said about Properties as an example but we do not think about abstracting that so people can plug in their own configuration library and what have you. I think the reason is that Properties comes in just above the bar while the opposite is true for JUL of today ... and in the past it came in at zero because it didn't exist."

        "body": "One of the most useful features of Java 8 are the new default methods on interfaces. There are essentially two reasons (there may be others) why they have been introduced: Providing actual default implementations. Example: Iterator.remove() Allowing for JDK API evolution. Example: Iterable.forEach() From an API designer's perspective, I would have liked to be able to use other modifiers on interface methods, e.g. final. This would be useful when adding convenience methods, preventing \"accidental\" overrides in implementing classes: -CODE- . The above is already common practice if Sender were a class: -CODE- . Now, default and final are obviously contradicting keywords, but the default keyword itself would not have been strictly required, so I'm assuming that this contradiction is deliberate, to reflect the subtle differences between \"class methods with body\" (just methods) and \"interface methods with body\" (default methods), i.e. differences which I have not yet understood. At some point of time, support for modifiers like static and final on interface methods was not yet fully explored, citing Brian Goetz: -CODE- . Since that time in late 2011, obviously, support for static methods in interfaces was added. Clearly, this added a lot of value to the JDK libraries themselves, such as with Comparator.comparing(). Question: What is the reason final (and also static final) never made it to Java 8 interfaces?"

I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss. I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you know there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is System.gc() systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay? So the question is actually double: Why is or isn't it bad practice to call System.gc()? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle? Are there really garbage collector implementations that can do their work without stopping the world? Please shed some light over the various assertions people have made in the comments to my answer. Where's the threshold? Is it never a good idea to call System.gc(), or are there times when it's acceptable? If so, what are those times?"

In a single function that takes the base class, I do checks for if the class is an instance of the subclass and carry out some routine. One of the other ways I thought of solving it was to use a \"type id\" integer primitive instead, and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses, and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses \"type id\" to a constant mask representing the category. Is instanceof somehow optimized by the JVM to be faster than that? I want to stick to Java but the performance of the app is critical. It would be cool if someone that has been down this road before could offer some advice. Am I nitpicking too much or focusing on the wrong thing to optimize?"

So this is the line causing the problem every time I opened a new terminal window. Simply remove this line will solve the problem. You still need to follow what @aleroot said, but if that doesn't work for you, check the .bash_profile (or .bashrc) setting file to see if you've previously exported any java version."

Each value in the pair can have its own type (like the String and Integer example above), which is defined at declaration time. The collection will maintain its given order and will not treat one of the values as a unique key (as in a map). Essentially I want to be able to define an ARRAY of type <String,Integer> or any other 2 types. I realize that I can make a class with nothing but the 2 variables in it, but that seems overly verbose. I also realize that I could use a 2D array, but because of the different types I need to use, I'd have to make them arrays of OBJECT, and then I'd have to cast all the time. I only need to store pairs in the collection, so I only need two values per entry. Does something like this exist without going the class route? Thanks!"

        "body": "I've been working with JPA (implementation Hibernate) for some time now and each time I need to create entities I find myself struggling with issues as AccessType, immutable properties, equals/hashCode, ... . So I decided to try and find out the general best practice for each issue and write this down for personal use. I would not mind however for anyone to comment on it or to tell me where I'm wrong. Entity Class implement Serializable Reason: The specification says you have to, but some JPA providers do not enforce this. Hibernate as JPA provider does not enforce this, but it can fail somewhere deep in its stomach with ClassCastException, if Serializable has not been implemented. Constructors create a constructor with all required fields of the entity Reason: A constructor should always leave the instance created in a sane state. besides this constructor: have a package private default constructor Reason: Default constructor is required to have Hibernate initialize the entity; private is allowed but package private (or public) visibility is required for runtime proxy generation and efficient data retrieval without bytecode instrumentation. Fields/Properties Use field access in general and property access when needed Reason: this is probably the most debatable issue since there are no clear and convincing arguments for one or the other (property access vs field access); however, field access seems to be general favourite because of clearer code, better encapsulation and no need to create setters for immutable fields Omit setters for immutable fields (not required for access type field) properties may be private Reason: I once heard that protected is better for (Hibernate) performance but all I can find on the web is: Hibernate can access public, private, and protected accessor methods, as well as public, private and protected fields directly. The choice is up to you and you can match it to fit your application design. Equals/hashCode Never use a generated id if this id is only set when persisting the entity By preference: use immutable values to form a unique Business Key and use this to test equality if a unique Business Key is not available use a non-transient UUID which is created when the entity is initialised; See this great article for more information. never refer to related entities (ManyToOne); if this entity (like a parent entity) needs to be part of the Business Key then compare the ID's only. Calling getId() on a proxy will not trigger the loading of the entity, as long as you're using property access type. Example Entity -CODE- . Other suggestions to add to this list are more than welcome... UPDATE Since reading this article I have adapted my way of implementing eq/hC: if an immutable simple business key is available: use that in all other cases: use a uuid"

        "body": "Being somewhat new to the Java language I'm trying to familiarize myself with all the ways (or at least the non-pathological ones) that one might iterate through a list (or perhaps other collections) and the advantages or disadvantages of each. Given a List<E> list object, I know of the following ways to loop through all elements: Basic for loop (of course, there're equivalent while / do while loops as well) -CODE- . Note: As @amarseillan pointed out, this form is a poor choice for iterating over Lists, because the actual implementation of the get method may not be as efficient as when using an Iterator. For example, LinkedList implementations must traverse all of the elements preceding i to get the i-th element. In the above example there's no way for the List implementation to \"save its place\" to make future iterations more efficient. For an ArrayList it doesn't really matter, because the complexity/cost of get is constant time (O(1)) whereas for a LinkedList is it proportional to the size of the list (O(n)). For more information about the computational complexity of the built-in Collections implementations, check out this question. Enhanced for loop (nicely explained in this question) -CODE- . Iterator -CODE- . ListIterator -CODE- . Functional Java -CODE- . Iterable.forEach, Stream.forEach, ... (A map method from Java 8's Stream API (see @i_am_zero's answer).) In Java 8 collection classes that implement Iterable (for example, all Lists) now have a forEach method, which can be used instead of the for loop statement demonstrated above. (Here is another question that provides a good comparison.) -CODE- . What other ways are there, if any? (BTW, my interest does not stem at all from a desire to optimize performance; I just want to know what forms are available to me as a developer.)"

It seems to me to be an odd omission, given that they allow one to write code that is less likely to produce overflows on unexpectedly large input. Furthermore, using unsigned integers can be a form of self-documentation, since they indicate that the value which the unsigned int was intended to hold is never supposed to be negative. Lastly, in some cases, unsigned integers can be more efficient for certain operations, such as division. What's the downside to including these?"

Assume the following hierarchy - Animal (Parent) Dog - Cat (Children) So suppose I have a method doSomething(List<Animal> animals). By all the rules of inheritance and polymorphism, I would assume that a List<Dog> is a List<Animal> and a List<Cat> is a List<Animal> - and so either one could be passed to this method. Not so. If I want to achieve this behavior, I have to explicitly tell the method to accept a list of any subclass of Animal by saying doSomething(List<? extends Animal> animals). I understand that this is Java's behavior. My question is why? Why is polymorphism generally implicit, but when it comes to generics it must be specified?"

        "body": "In Hidden Features of Java the top answer mentions Double Brace Initialization, with a very enticing syntax: -CODE- . This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which \"can use any [...] methods in the containing scope\". Main question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds? Should its use be limited to one-off initializations? (And of course showing off!) Second question: The new HashSet must be the \"this\" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism? Third question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code? Summary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it). On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases. Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a \"this\" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat. Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity. Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals. Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java. Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics! ;-) Thanks everyone! 7/2017: Baeldung has a good summary of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern. 12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say: -CODE- . That's for sure the way to go. If you're stuck with an earlier version, take a look at Google Collections' ImmutableSet."

Dead code still has unit tests, and shows up as covered.

All through the code I wrote used quite a good number of statics. I was asked by the senior technical lot to cut down on the number of statics used. I've googled about the same, and I find that many programmers are fairly against using static variables. I find static variables more convenient to use. And I presume that they are efficient too (please correct me if I am wrong), because if I had to make 10,000 calls to a function within a class, I would be glad to make the method static and use a straightforward Class.methodCall() on it instead of cluttering the memory with 10,000 instances of the class, right? Moreover statics reduce the inter-dependencies on the other parts of the code. They can act as perfect state holders. Adding to this I find that statics are widely implemented in some languages like Smalltalk and Scala. So why is this oppression for statics prevalent among programmers (especially in the world of Java)? PS: please do correct me if my assumptions about statics are wrong."

So I copied java.math.BigInteger source into my own package and tried this: -CODE- . When I run this (jdk 1.8.0_144-b01 on MacOS) it outputs: -CODE- . When I run it with the import line uncommented: -CODE- . It's almost three times as fast when using the JDK version of BigInteger versus my version, even if it's using the exact same code. I've examined the bytecode with javap, and compared compiler output when running with options: -CODE- . and both versions seem to generate the same code. So is hotspot using some precomputed optimisations that I can't use in my code? I always understood that they don't. What explains this difference?"

Earlier I was using one Servlet per options like Servlet1 for add entity1, Servlet2 for edit entity1 and so on and in this way we ended up having a large number of servlets. Now we are changing our design. My question is how you exactly choose how you choose the responsibility of a servlet. Should we have one Servlet per entity which will process all it's options and forward request to the service layer. Or should we have one servlet for the whole page which will process the whole page request and then forward it to the corresponding service layer? Also, should the request object forwarded to service layer or not."

Then the client, for each request, will send the token instead of username and password. I was thinking of using a custom filter for each request and @PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('ROLE')\") but I just thought that this causes a lot of requests to the database to check if the token is valid.

However, since I migrated to Java 8 (1.8.0-ea-b90) Maven is absolutely strict about missing documentation tags and show me lots of Javadoc errors related to Javadoc problems when I try to build or install a project where the Javadoc is not \"perfect\". Some of the projects I am trying to compile and install in my local repository are third party projects from which I do not have control. So the workaround of just fixing all the Javadocs in all these projects does not seem to be feasable in my scenario. This is a small part of the output I see when I execute mvn clean package install in my project: -CODE- . The Javadoc Maven plugin is configured like this in my POM: -CODE- . As I said before, everything is working fine if I go back to Java 7. Maybe is this a bug related to Maven running in Java 8? How could I make it work (i.e., being able to build the Javadoc of the project and install its code in my local repository) with Java 8? I have tested with both Maven 3.0.3 and 3.0.5 in OSX. UPDATE: If I change my Javadoc plugin configuration with <failOnError>false</failOnError> (thanks Martin): -CODE- . Then the project is installed in my local repository. However, the Javadoc JAR is still not generated. A fragment of the output I see in the console with this new configuration is: -CODE- . Any workaround about how to build the sources, install the project and generate the Javadoc JAR in one step as it was working with Java 7?"

Examples: jon skeet -> Jon Skeet miles o'Brien -> Miles O'Brien (B remains capital, this rules out Title Case) old mcdonald -> Old Mcdonald* *(Old McDonald would be find too, but I don't expect it to be THAT smart.) A quick look at the Java String Documentation reveals only toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(), which of course do not provide the desired behavior. Naturally, Google results are dominated by those two functions. It seems like a wheel that must have been invented already, so it couldn't hurt to ask so I can use it in the future."

12	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33170109	Difference between `Optional.orElse()` and `Optional.orElseGet()`	Difference between `Optional.orElse()` and `Optional.orElseGet()`	"I am trying to understand the difference between the Optional<T>.orElse() and Optional<T>.orElseGet() methods. The description for the orElse() method is ""Return the value if present, otherwise return other."" While, the description for the orElseGet() method is ""Return the value if present, otherwise invoke other and return the result of that invocation."" The orElseGet() method takes a Supplier functional interface, which essentially does not take any parameters and returns T. In which situation would you need to use orElseGet()? If you have a method T myDefault() why wouldn't you just do optional.orElse(myDefault()) rather than optional.orElseGet(() -> myDefault()) ? It does not seem that orElseGet() is postponing the execution of the lambda expression to some later time or something, so what's the point of it? (I would have thought that it would be more useful if it returned a safer Optional<T> whose get() never throws a NoSuchElementException and isPresent() always returns true... but evidently its not, it just returns T like orElse()). Is there some other difference I am missing?"	yes

[4]Development tools: I believe there isn't such a tool yet as Visual Studio. Especially if you've worked with team editions you'll know what I mean.. Please add others you think are relevant. Update: Just popped up my mind, Java doesn't have something like custom attributes on classes, methods etc. Or does it?"	no

[3]To check the cert was added to my cacert successfully, I did this: keytool -list -v -keystore cacerts I can see the cert is present.. [4]I then restarted Glassfish and retired the 'post'.. I am still getting thesame error. I have a feeling this is because my Glassfish is not actually reading the cacert file that I have amended but maybe some other one. Have any of you had this issue and can push me in the right direction?"	no

We're going to start altering our working practices to mitigate the problem, including a greater emphasis on the hosted-mode browser, which defers the need to run the GWT compiler until a later time, but that brings its own risks, particularly that of not catching issues with real browsers until much later than we'd like. Ideally, we'd like to make the GWT compiler itself quicker - a minute to compile a fairly small application is taking the piss. However, we are using the compile if a fairly naive fashion, so I'm hoping we can make some quick and easy gains. We're currently invoking com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler as a java application from ant Ant target, with 256m max heap and lots of stack space. The compiler is launched by Ant using fork=true and the latest Java 6 JRE, to try and take advantage of Java6's improved performance.

"I think I understand the basic concepts of MVC - the Model contains the data and behaviour of the application, the View is responsible for displaying it to the user and the Controller deals with user input. What I'm uncertain about is exactly what goes in the Controller. Lets say for example I have a fairly simple application (I'm specifically thinking Java, but I suppose the same principles apply elsewhere). I organise my code into 3 packages called app.model, app.view and app.controller. Within the app.model package, I have a few classes that reflect the actual behaviour of the application. These extends Observable and use setChanged() and notifyObservers() to trigger the views to update when appropriate. The app.view package has a class (or several classes for different types of display) that uses javax.swing components to handle the display. Some of these components need to feed back into the Model. If I understand correctly, the View shouldn't have anything to do with the feedback - that should be dealt with by the Controller. So what do I actually put in the Controller? Do I put the public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) in the View with just a call to a method in the Controller? If so, should any validation etc be done in the Controller? If so, how do I feedback error messages back to the View - should that go through the Model again, or should the Controller just send it straight back to View? If the validation is done in the View, what do I put in the Controller?

Making a OneToOne-relation lazy	"In this application we are developing, we noticed that a view was particularly slow. I profiled the view and noticed that there was one query executed by hibernate which took 10 seconds even if there only were two object in the database to fetch. All OneToMany and ManyToMany relations were lazy so that wasn't the problem. When inspecting the actual SQL being executed, I noticed that there were over 80 joins in the query. Further inspecting the issue, I noticed that the problem was caused by the deep hierarchy of OneToOne and ManyToOne relations between entity classes. So, I thought, I'll just make them fetched lazy, that should solve the problem. But annotating either @OneToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) or @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) doesn't seem to work.

"In Java, using throw/catch as a part of logic when there's not actually an error is generally a bad idea (in part) because throwing and catching an exception is expensive, and doing it many times in a loop is usually far slower than other control structures which don't involve throwing exceptions. My question is, is the cost incurred in the throw/catch itself, or when creating the Exception object (since it gets a lot of runtime information including the execution stack)? In other words, if I do: -CODE- . but don't throw it, is that most of the cost of throwing, or is the throw + catch handling what's costly? I'm not asking whether putting code in a try/catch block adds to the cost of executing that code, I'm asking whether catching the Exception is the expensive part, or creating (calling the constructor for) the Exception is the expensive part. Another way of asking this is, if I made one instance of Exception and threw and caught it over and over, would that be significantly faster than creating a new Exception every time I throw?"	no

Also if you look in the sources the toString() method returns exactly and just the name. It's the same thing.	no

Now to be sure, I am not advocating that this is a good implementation of quick sort! It is however great example of the expressive power of lambda expression combined with stream operation.

"Virtual Memory Usage from Java under Linux, too much memory used"	"I have a problem with a Java application running under Linux. When I launch the application, using the default maximum heap size (64 MB), I see using the tops application that 240 MB of virtual Memory are allocated to the application. This creates some issues with some other software on the computer, which is relatively resource-limited. The reserved virtual memory will not be used anyway, as far as I understand, because once we reach the heap limit an OutOfMemoryError is thrown. I ran the same application under windows and I see that the Virtual Memory size and the Heap size are similar. Is there anyway that I can configure the Virtual Memory in use for a Java process under Linux? Edit 1: The problem is not the Heap. The problem is that if I set a Heap of 128 MB, for example, still Linux allocates 210 MB of Virtual Memory, which is not needed, ever.** Edit 2: Using ulimit -v allows limiting the amount of virtual memory. If the size set is below 204 MB, then the application won't run even though it doesn't need 204 MB, only 64 MB. So I want to understand why Java requires so much virtual memory. Can this be changed?

Java time-based map/cache with expiring keys	"Do any of you know of a Java Map or similar standard data store that automatically purges entries after a given timeout? This means aging, where the old expired entries â€œage-outâ€?automatically. Preferably in an open source library that is accessible via Maven? I know of ways to implement the functionality myself and have done it several times in the past, so I'm not asking for advice in that respect, but for pointers to a good reference implementation. WeakReference based solutions like WeakHashMap are not an option, because my keys are likely to be non-interned strings and I want a configurable timeout that's not dependent on the garbage collector. Ehcache is also an option I wouldn't like to rely on because it needs external configuration files. I am looking for a code-only solution."	no

I was building a simple program to display every X outputs in a for loop, and I noticed a MASSIVE decrease in performance, when I used modulus as variable % variable vs variable % 5000 or whatnot. Can someone explain to me why this is and what is causing it? So I can be better... Here is the ""efficient"" code (sorry if I get a bit of syntax wrong I'm not on the computer with the code right now) -CODE- . Here is the ""inefficient code"" -CODE- . Mind you I had a date variable to measure the differences, and once it became long enough, the first one took 50ms while the other took 12 seconds or something like that. You may have to increase the stopNum or decrease the progressCheck if your PC is more efficient than mine or what not. I looked for this question around the web, but I can't find an answer, maybe I'm just not asking it right. EDIT: I did not expect my question to be so popular, I appreciate all the answers. I did perform a benchmark on each half in time taken, and the inefficient code took considerably longer, 1/4 of a second vs 10 seconds give or take. Granted they are using println, but they are both doing the same amount, so I wouldn't imagine that would skew it much, especially since the discrepancy is repeatable. As for the answers, since I am new to Java, I will let votes decide for now which answer is best. I will try to pick one by Wednesday. EDIT2: I am going to make another test tonight, where instead of modulus, it just increments a variable, and when it reaches progressCheck, it will perform one, and then reset that variable to 0. for a 3rd option. EDIT3.5: I used this code, and below I'll show my results.. Thank you ALL for the wonderful help! I also tried comparing the short value of the long to 0, so all my new checks happen ever ""65536"" times making it equal in repeats. -CODE- . Results: [1]fixed = 874 ms (normally around 1000ms, but faster due to it being a power of 2). [2]variable = 8590 ms. [3]final variable = 1944 ms (Was ~1000ms when using 50000). [4]increment = 1904 ms. [5]Short Conversion = 679 ms. Not surprising enough, due to a lack of division, the Short Conversion was 23% faster than the ""fast"" way. This is interesting to note. If you need to show or compare something every 256 times (or about there) you can do this, and use : -CODE- . ONE FINAL INTERESTING NOTE, using modulus on the ""Final declared Variable"" with 65536 (not a pretty number) was half the speed of (slower) than the fixed value. Where before it was benchmarking near the same speed."	no

FixedThreadPool vs CachedThreadPool: the lesser of two evils	"So I have a program that spawns threads (~5-150) which perform a bunch of tasks. Originally I used a FixedThreadPool because this similar question suggested they were better suited for longer lived tasks and with my very limited knowledge of multithreading, I considered the average life of the threads (several minutes) ""long lived"". However, I recently added the capability to spawn additional threads and doing so takes me above the thread limit I set. In this case, would it be better to guess and increase the number threads I can allow or to switch to a CachedThreadPool so I have no wasted threads? Trying them both out preliminarily, there doesn't seem to be a difference so I'm inclined to go with the CachedThreadPool just to avoid the waste. However, does the life span of the threads mean I should instead picked a FixedThreadPool and just deal with the unused threads?

Java 8 java.time: Adding TemporalUnit in Instant vs LocalDateTime	"I'm playing around with the new java.time package in Java 8. I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments. I think I have a better idea now about how LocalDateTime and Instant are playing with java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp. Thanks everyone. Now, a more practical consideration. Let's say a user sends me a date from wherever they are in the world, arbitrary time zone. They send me 2014-04-16T13:00:00 which I can parse into a LocalDateTime. I then convert this directly to a java.sql.Timestamp and persist in my database. Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s). Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones.

I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments. I think I have a better idea now about how LocalDateTime and Instant are playing with java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp. Thanks everyone. Now, a more practical consideration. Let's say a user sends me a date from wherever they are in the world, arbitrary time zone. They send me 2014-04-16T13:00:00 which I can parse into a LocalDateTime. I then convert this directly to a java.sql.Timestamp and persist in my database. Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s). Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones. Should I not be going directly from Local time as a string (2014-04-16T13:00:00) to LocalDateTime? Should I be expecting a time zone from the user input?"	no

993	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17683575	I've been trying to understand Reentrant locks and Semaphores ( the nesting of Reentrant locks vs release/unlock mechanism ).	Binary Semaphore vs a ReentrantLock	"I've been trying to understand Reentrant locks and Semaphores ( the nesting of Reentrant locks vs release/unlock mechanism ). It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it. When I tested my test code, I found out that this may subsequently increase the number of permits beyond the initial limit. On the other hand, if a thread is not holding a reentrant lock when it invokes the unlock method, we get an IllegalMonitorException. So would it be right to say that there is no real reason ever to have a binary semaphore as everything that a binary semaphore can do can also be done by a ReentrantLock.

The problem is I cannot cast a javax.security.cert.X509Certificate to java.security.cert.X509Certificate. Any ideas on what to do, to transform raw bytes into a java.security.cert.X509Certificate? Also, what's the differences between the one abstract class and the other class? Why does java has two of them with different functionality?"	no

The documentation ([http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html][1]) for java.util.Random clearly states the following: -CODE- . However, the way the code is currently using java.util.Random is this - It instantiates the java.security.SecureRandom class and then uses the SecureRandom.nextLong() method to obtain the seed that is used for instantiating the java.util.Randomclass. Then it uses java.util.Random.nextLong() method to generate the token. So my question now - Is it still insecure given that the java.util.Random is being seeded using java.security.SecureRandom? Do I need to modify the code so that it uses java.security.SecureRandom exclusively to generate the tokens? Currently the code seed's the Random once at startup."	no

I am of the opinion that from a memory allocation perspective LinkedList would be a better option than ArrayList, as for an ArrayList once the max size is reached, automatically the memory allocation doubles and hence there would always be a chance of more memory being allocated than what is needed. I understand from other posts here that individual elements stored in a LinkedList takes more space than an ArrayList as LinkedList also needs to store the node information, but I am still guessing for the scenario I have defined LinkedList might be a better option. Also, I do not want to get into the performance aspect (fetching, deleting etc) , as much has already been discussed on it."	no

Does it read a as one byte and recognize the other of characters as two bytes, or for every character in this text, does the InputStreamReader read it as two bytes?"	no

Originally I used a FixedThreadPool because this similar question suggested they were better suited for longer lived tasks and with my very limited knowledge of multithreading, I considered the average life of the threads (several minutes) ""long lived"". However, I recently added the capability to spawn additional threads and doing so takes me above the thread limit I set. In this case, would it be better to guess and increase the number threads I can allow or to switch to a CachedThreadPool so I have no wasted threads? Trying them both out preliminarily, there doesn't seem to be a difference so I'm inclined to go with the CachedThreadPool just to avoid the waste. However, does the life span of the threads mean I should instead picked a FixedThreadPool and just deal with the unused threads?

I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments. I think I have a better idea now about how LocalDateTime and Instant are playing with java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp. Thanks everyone. Now, a more practical consideration. Let's say a user sends me a date from wherever they are in the world, arbitrary time zone. They send me 2014-04-16T13:00:00 which I can parse into a LocalDateTime. I then convert this directly to a java.sql.Timestamp and persist in my database. Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s). Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones. Should I not be going directly from Local time as a string (2014-04-16T13:00:00) to LocalDateTime? Should I be expecting a time zone from the user input? "	yes

It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it. When I tested my test code, I found out that this may subsequently increase the number of permits beyond the initial limit. On the other hand, if a thread is not holding a reentrant lock when it invokes the unlock method, we get an IllegalMonitorException. So would it be right to say that there is no real reason ever to have a binary semaphore as everything that a binary semaphore can do can also be done by a ReentrantLock. If we use binary semaphores we would have to check the entire method call stack to see if a permit was acquired before ( also was it released too if there is a possibility of a subsequent acquire - which might block if a release does not proceed it and so on ). Also since reentrant locks also provide one lock per object, isn't it always a better idea to prefer a reentrant lock to a binary semaphore? I have checked a post here that talks about difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex but is there a thing like a mutex in Java? Thanks, Chan. P.S - I had posted this question in another forum ( http://www.coderanch.com/t/615796/threads/java/reason-prefer-binary-Semaphore-Reentrant ) and I haven't received a response yet.

One way to make it more efficient is to implement Externalizable and its writeExternal/readExternal methods. Here's the question: if I instead provide 'writeObject/readObject' methods and don't call deafiltWriteObject/defaultReadObject in them, then this mechanism won't use reflection to figure out which fields to write/read, plus it won't write extra data to stream (or will it? not sure). So from an efficiency perspective, is implementing writeObject/readObject mentioned above same as implementing Externalizable? Or does the latter option give some more practical benefits which the former doesn't? EDIT: a difference, ofcourse, is when a Serializable class implementing readObject/writeObject is subclassed, and if the subclass has its own readObject/writeObject, they don't need to call super's readObject/writeObject. Not so if the super/subclass instead implement Externalizable. In this case, super's writeExternal/readExternal need to be explicitly called.

"I looked under the hood for EnumSet.allOf and it looks very efficient, especially for enums with less than 64 values. Basically all sets share the single array of all possible enum values and the only other piece of information is a bitmask which in case of allOf is set in one swoop. On the other hand Enum.values() seems to be a bit of black magic. Moreover it returns an array, not a collection, so in many cases it must be decorated with Arrays.asList( ) to be usable in any place that expects collection. So, should EnumSet.allOf be more preferable to Enum.values? More specifically, which form of for iterator should be used: -CODE- . or: -CODE- . "	yes

The token is a ""long"" so it is 64 bits long. The code currently uses the java.util.Random class to generate these tokens.

However, the way the code is currently using java.util.Random is this - It instantiates the java.security.SecureRandom class and then uses the SecureRandom.nextLong() method to obtain the seed that is used for instantiating the java.util.Randomclass.

Browsing the directory clearly shows that the new file is there. The filenames were prepended with a forward slash as in ""/myFile.txt"". The ClassLoader version of getResource() on the other hand did find the generated file. From this experience it seems that there is some kind of caching of the directory listing going on. Am I right, and if so, where is this documented? From the API docs on Class.getResource() -CODE- . To me, this reads ""Class.getResource is really calling its own classloader's getResource()"".

My conclusion so far: [1]I won't ever need SynchronousQueue. [2]LinkedBlockingQueue ensures FIFO, BlockingQueue must be created with parameter true to make it FIFO. [3]SynchronousQueue breaks most collections method (contains, size, etc). So when do I ever need SynchronousQueue? Is the performance of this implementation better than LinkedBlockingQueue? To make it more complicated... why does Executors.newCachedThreadPool use SynchronousQueue when the others (Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor and Executors.newFixedThreadPool) use LinkedBlockingQueue? EDIT. The first question is solved. But I still don't understand why does Executors.newCachedThreadPool use SynchronousQueue when the others (Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor and Executors.newFixedThreadPool) use LinkedBlockingQueue?

This is not long running tasks (maximum a few seconds). Until now I was doing this kind of stuff with creating a new thread, passing it a new runnable with the task. But recently I have read an article about threads and concurrency in Java and understood that creating a new Thread for every single task is not a good decision. So now I have created a ThreadPoolExecutor in my Application class which holds 5 threads. Here is the code: -CODE- . And also I have a method to submit Runnable tasks to the executor: -CODE- . So when I want to run an asynchronous task in my code I get the instance of App and call the submitRunnableTask method passing the runnable to it. As you can see, I also check, if the thread pool has free threads to execute my task, if not, I create a new Thread (I don't think that this will happen, but in any case... I don't want my task to wait in a queue and slow down the app). In the onTerminate callback method of Application I shutdown the pool. So my question is the following: Is this kind of pattern better then creating new Threads in code? What pros and cons my new approach has? Can it cause problems that I am not aware off yet? Can you advice me something better than this to manage my asynchronous tasks? P.S. I have some experience in Android and Java, but I am far from being a concurrency guru ) So may be there are aspects that I don't understand well in this kind of questions.

[2]JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and _JAVA_OPTIONS are ways to specify JVM arguments as an environment variable instead of command line parameters.

This will not crash at all, even when I put some delay on consuming it still works. To make Flowable work lets say I put onBackpressureDrop operator, crash is gone but not all values are emitted either.

"I sometimes get confused by the different Date types in java and their practical usage. Here i am trying to summarize my understanding. java.sql.Date :- A thin wrapper around a millisecond value that allows JDBC to identify this as an SQL DATE value. java.sql.Timestamp :- A thin wrapper around java.util.Date that allows the JDBC API to identify this as an SQL TIMESTAMP value. It adds the ability to hold the SQL TIMESTAMP fractional seconds value, by allowing the specification of fractional seconds to a precision of nanoseconds. I have seen most of the projects prefer Timestamp instead of date. I think the main reason for this is that Timestamp can hold the value till nano seconds precision whereas Data can hold till milli seconds. Correct? Calendar :- This class is designed for date manipulation for example :- for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.Though i dont know why this class is abstract when only one implementation exists i.e GregorianCalendar.

I see this as quite a legitimate answer, and I personally have used this in many of my own Java projects without problem. However, I always get downvotes for my answer, and everyone just says ""Use a CardLayout"". So my question is, why is everyone so fascinated with CardLayout, to the point where my answer deserves a downvote? Why should I choose to use a CardLayout rather than adding/removing panels using my code above? As a further question, would you still be suggesting CardLayout for interfaces that have dynamic JPanels. For example, most of my programs implement a custom plugin framework where there could be many hundreds of JPanels, but I only load and display the panels as they are actually required. For the normal use of the program, most of the panels would never actually be loaded or required. For this type of scenario, would my coding approach be the best solution, as I understand that CardLayout would require me to actually create all of the JPanels even though most will never be used?

2255	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29042622	Which one to use? JSONObject from org.json VS JsonObject from javax.json	Which one to use? JSONObject from org.json VS JsonObject from javax.json	"This is my first post. As a budding Android developer, I read SO posts on a near daily basis on various topics, but for this question, I didn't find any help from Google or SO. My research so far: Searching for this question was harder than normal because the search engines don't seem to care about case-sensitivity, which is vital in this issue. Searching Google only gave me links to the classes themselves, old articles, or completely irrelevant articles. The closest I got was JSONArray vs JSONObject, and that is a completely different question. SO searching gave the same results. As far as I can tell, ALL pertinent posts on SO refer to JSONObject and not JsonObject. Neither Oracle nor json.org documentation mentioned the other side, nor did the Android developer JSONObject page which uses the org.json library. http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/json/JsonObject.html http://www.json.org/javadoc/org/json/JSONObject.html I would have also posted a link to the Android reference page for JSONObject, but my rep as a newbie is too low. History of problem(s): I was reading about Json encoding and decoding from the Oracle page, and I tried copying and pasting into my AndriodStudio IDE, which immediately produced an error, for which it did not suggest an import statement like it normally does. I have come to learn that means the class is not part of the built-in libraries. The problem was that the code I pasted in used JsonObject (which comes from javax.json library) and not JSONObject (which comes from org.json library). When I noticed the difference in case between the Android page and the Oracle page, I altered my code from Json to JSON and immediately my IDE offered the org.json import statement. Question(s): Why is an Oracle made class not part of the default libraries when an external library is? Is JSON the old, deprecated way and Json the new, proper way? Are they functionally identical? If not, please provide examples? Are some situations better for one and some better for the other? ULTIMATELY, which should I use, and why (if not already covered)? If, javax.json, where is the best (safest) place to download that library)? "	yes

"I'm currently building a Spring MVC application. I was looking to use JSP pages with tag libraries for handling the view layer and formatting of the HTML, but I've come across another group in my company that uses Velocity templates for the same purpose. From what I can see, it seems to me as if there are a lot of similarities between the two approaches: [1]Both have easy-to-understand syntax. Makes it easy for non-developers to understand and use, allowing the designers to focus on the HTML/CSS and only having to use directives/tag libraries in the few cases where they need conditionals/dynamic content without having to have a full understanding of Java. . [2]Simple to see which part of the content is HTML vs which are directives/logic.. [3]Both are heavily used and well supported.. [4]Simple to integrate with Spring MVC.. But in comparing the two technologies, I can't see any specific reasons to use one versus the other. I'm having trouble thinking of any cons specific to either Velocity or JSTL. So my question is, what are the pros and cons of each in your opinion? If you have built a (Spring) MVC app using one or the other, what made you decide on the view layer technology you are using and what (if anything) made you decide against the other? Update: I've found a similar discussion of this same topic archived on the Spring Framework forum's here, which might be of some interest to anyone making the same decision between JSTL and Velocity as I am.

I mean, I know how to use them, but I've always used StringBuilder. Is there a concrete reason for preferring one over the other? The StringBuilder method seems much more natural to me, but is it just style? I've looked at several questions here (including this one which comes closest: StringWriter or StringBuilder ), but none in which the answers actually address the question of whether there's a reason to prefer one over the other for simple string assembly. This is the idiom I've seen and used many many times: string assembly by StringBuilder: -CODE- . And this is the new idiom: string assembly by StringWriter and PrintWriter: -CODE- . Edit It appears that there is no concrete reason to prefer one over the other, so I've accepted the answer which best matches my understanding, and +1ed all the other answers. In addition, I posted an answer of my own, giving the results of the benchmarking I ran, in response to one of the answers. Thanks to all. Edit again It turns out that there is a concrete reason to prefer one (specifically the StringBuilder) over the other. What I missed the first time was the addition of the newline.

In the AuthenticationProvider you can check the username and password and return Authentication with your custom object in it. -CODE- . In the UserDetailsService you get only the username and when you return the custom UserDeatails, the framework performs a check on the password. -CODE- . Looks like both can produce similar results. So the question is what is the difference? When to user one vs the other? "	yes

"I'm using Quartz Scheduler v.1.8.0. What's the difference between scheduler.standby() and scheduler.pauseAll()? -CODE- . Based on what I've understood from the API documentation, I'm not able to easily/clearly differentiate/distinguish from each one of them. I'm seeing both of them serving the same purpose - temporarily pause/halt all the triggers in the scheduler, and subsequently followed by a start() (for standby) or resumeAll() (for pauseAll) to clear the scheduler's state. Is there any other difference? Hope experts can help me in understanding any subtle difference. "	yes

The Lucene OpenBitSet claims that it is faster than the Java BitSet implementation in almost all of the operations. http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.lucene/lucene-core/4.10.4/org/apache/lucene/util/OpenBitSet.java#OpenBitSet . I tried to look at the code for both the implementations. Java BitSet code. http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/8u40-b25/java/util/BitSet.java#BitSet. It seems to me that both these classes use an array of 'long' to store the bits. Individual bits are mapped to a particular array index and a bit position in the 'long' value stored at the index. What is the reason, then that the OpenBitSet implementation is far better in terms of performance ? Where is the difference in the code that leads to this improvement in speed ? "	yes

What's the difference between JTable.getModel().getColumnName() and JTable.getColumnModel().getColumn(index).getHeaderValue()? The two don't seem to share any data. My guess is that TableModel.getColumnName() indicates the textual representation of a column while TableColumn.getHeaderValue() and TableColumn.getHeaderRenderer() determine what the column looks like (it doesn't need to be plain text).

2290	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11552248	When to use @QueryParam vs @PathParam	When to use @QueryParam vs @PathParam	"I am not asking the question that is already asked here: What is the difference between @PathParam and @QueryParam. This is a ""best practices"" or convention question. When would you use @PathParam vs @QueryParam. What I can think of that the decision might be using the two to differentiate the information pattern. Let me illustrate below my LTPO - less than perfect observation. PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy. Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class. For example, [1]/Vehicle/Car?registration=123. [2]/House/Colonial?region=newengland. /category?instance: -CODE- . vs /category/instance: -CODE- . vs ?category+instance: -CODE- . I don't think there is a standard convention of doing it. Is there? However, I would like to hear of how people use PathParam vs QueryParam to differentiate their information like I exemplified above. I would also love to hear the reason behind the practice. "	yes

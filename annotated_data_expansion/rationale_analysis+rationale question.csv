1,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53749841,Why is x ==,Why is x == (x = y) not the same as (x = y) == x?,"Consider the following example: -CODE- . I'm not sure if there is an item in the Java Language Specification that dictates loading the previous value of a variable for comparison with the right side (x = y) which, by the order implied by brackets, should be calculated first. Why does the first expression evaluate to false, but the second evaluate to true? I would have expected (x = y) to be evaluated first, and then it would compare x with itself (3) and return true. This question is different from order of evaluation of subexpressions in a Java expression in that x is definitely not a 'subexpression' here. It needs to be loaded for the comparison rather than to be 'evaluated'. The question is Java-specific and the expression x == (x = y), unlike far-fetched impractical constructs commonly crafted for tricky interview questions, came from a real project. It was supposed to be a one-line replacement for the compare-and-replace idiom: -CODE- . which, being even simpler than x86 CMPXCHG instruction, deserved a shorter expression in Java.",no

This question has been flagged as a possible duplicate of Java static final field initialization order.

Why does the first expression evaluate to false, but the second evaluate to true? I would have expected (x = y) to be evaluated first, and then it would compare x with itself (3) and return true. This question is different from order of evaluation of subexpressions in a Java expression in that x is definitely not a 'subexpression' here. It needs to be loaded for the comparison rather than to be 'evaluated'. The question is Java-specific and the expression x == (x = y), unlike far-fetched impractical constructs commonly crafted for tricky interview questions, came from a real project.

Can someone explain to me why this is and what is causing it? So I can be better... Here is the ""efficient"" code (sorry if I get a bit of syntax wrong I'm not on the computer with the code right now) -CODE- . Here is the ""inefficient code"" -CODE- . Mind you I had a date variable to measure the differences, and once it became long enough, the first one took 50ms while the other took 12 seconds or something like that. You may have to increase the stopNum or decrease the progressCheck if your PC is more efficient than mine or what not. I looked for this question around the web, but I can't find an answer, maybe I'm just not asking it right. EDIT: I did not expect my question to be so popular, I appreciate all the answers. I did perform a benchmark on each half in time taken, and the inefficient code took considerably longer, 1/4 of a second vs 10 seconds give or take. Granted they are using println, but they are both doing the same amount, so I wouldn't imagine that would skew it much, especially since the discrepancy is repeatable. As for the answers, since I am new to Java, I will let votes decide for now which answer is best. I will try to pick one by Wednesday. EDIT2: I am going to make another test tonight, where instead of modulus, it just increments a variable, and when it reaches progressCheck, it will perform one, and then reset that variable to 0. for a 3rd option.

[4]increment = 1904 ms. [5]Short Conversion = 679 ms. Not surprising enough, due to a lack of division, the Short Conversion was 23% faster than the ""fast"" way. This is interesting to note. If you need to show or compare something every 256 times (or about there) you can do this, and use : -CODE- .

This means that you cannot sort Numbers with Collections.sort which seems to me a little strange. Post discussion update: Thanks for all the helpful responses. I ended up doing some more research about this topic. The simplest explanation for why java.lang.Number does not implement Comparable is rooted in mutability concerns. For a bit of review, java.lang.Number is the abstract super-type of AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, BigDecimal, BigInteger, Byte, Double, Float, Integer, Long and Short. On that list, AtomicInteger and AtomicLong to do not implement Comparable. Digging around, I discovered that it is not a good practice to implement Comparable on mutable types because the objects can change during or after comparison rendering the result of the comparison useless. Both AtomicLong and AtomicInteger are mutable. The API designers had the forethought to not have Number implement Comparable because it would have constrained implementation of future subtypes. Indeed, AtomicLong and AtomicInteger were added in Java 1.5 long after java.lang.Number was initially implemented. Apart from mutability, there are probably other considerations here too. A compareTo implementation in Number would have to promote all numeric values to BigDecimal because it is capable of accommodating all the Number sub-types.

In the case of integers, longs, chars this makes sense. These variables can contain the full range of values enforced by their size.

Does it treat the boolean as a single bit entity for the purpose of the operation? Or is the result undefined along with the size of a boolean?",no

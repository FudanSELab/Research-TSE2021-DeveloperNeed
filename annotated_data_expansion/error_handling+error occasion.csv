AFAICT, the only hamcrest jars in my classpath is 1.3.RC2. Is IntelliJ IDEA using it's own copy of JUnit or Hamcrest? How do I output the runtime CLASSPATH that IntelliJ is using?",yes

I have this regex: \b[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b In Java, I did this: Pattern p = Pattern.compile(""\\b[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z]{2,4}\\b""); Matcher m = p.matcher(""foobar@gmail.com""); if (m.find()) System.out.println(""Correct!""); However, the regex fails regardless of whether the email is wel-formed or not. A ""find and replace"" inside Eclipse works fine with the same regex. Any idea? Thanks,",no

I have a legacy database that gives me java.util.Date, which I convert to Instant. What I am trying to do is add a period of time that is based off of another database flag. I could be adding days, weeks, months, or years. I don't want to have to care what I am adding, and I would like to be able to add more options in the future. My first thought was Instant.plus(), but that gives me an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for values greater than a day. Instant apparently does not support operations on large units of time. Fine, whatever, LocalDateTime does. So that gives me this code: -CODE- . Now, this is my first time using the new time API, so I may have missed something here. But it seems clunky to me that I have to go: -CODE- . Even if I did not have to use the Date part, I would still think it was a bit awkward. So my question is this, am I doing this completely wrong and what is the best way to do this? Edit: Expanding on the discussion in the comments. I think I have a better idea now about how LocalDateTime and Instant are playing with java.util.Date and java.sql.Timestamp. Thanks everyone. Now, a more practical consideration. Let's say a user sends me a date from wherever they are in the world, arbitrary time zone. They send me 2014-04-16T13:00:00 which I can parse into a LocalDateTime. I then convert this directly to a java.sql.Timestamp and persist in my database. Now, without doing anything else, I pull my java.sql.timestamp from my database, convert to LocalDateTime using timestamp.toLocalDateTime(). All good. Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s). Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones.

Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC.

Then I return this value to my user using the ISO_DATE_TIME formatting. The result is 2014-04-16T09:00:00. I assume this difference is because of some type of implicit conversion to/from UTC. I think my default time zone may be getting applied to the value (EDT, UTC-4) which would explain why the number is off by 4 hours. New question(s). Where is the implicit conversion from local time to UTC happening here? What is the better way to preserve time zones. Should I not be going directly from Local time as a string (2014-04-16T13:00:00) to LocalDateTime? Should I be expecting a time zone from the user input?",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17683575,I've been trying to understand Reentrant locks and Semaphores ( the nesting of Reentrant locks vs release/unlock mechanism ).,Binary Semaphore vs a ReentrantLock,"I've been trying to understand Reentrant locks and Semaphores ( the nesting of Reentrant locks vs release/unlock mechanism ). It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it. When I tested my test code, I found out that this may subsequently increase the number of permits beyond the initial limit. On the other hand, if a thread is not holding a reentrant lock when it invokes the unlock method, we get an IllegalMonitorException. So would it be right to say that there is no real reason ever to have a binary semaphore as everything that a binary semaphore can do can also be done by a ReentrantLock. If we use binary semaphores we would have to check the entire method call stack to see if a permit was acquired before ( also was it released too if there is a possibility of a subsequent acquire - which might block if a release does not proceed it and so on ).

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17683575,It seems that having a Semaphore requires you to write a more thoroughly tested application because the release() method does not check if the thread releasing the permit is actually holding it.,Binary Semaphore vs a ReentrantLock,"I've been trying to understand Reentrant locks and Semaphores ( the nesting of Reentrant locks vs release/unlock mechanism ).

Both will return the first argument if it is non-null and otherwise returns the non-null second argument or the non-null value of supplier.get() -CODE- . But the new functionality overlaps with already existing in the Optional class Optional#orElse and Optional#orElseGet: -CODE- . The only difference between new methods in Objects and corresponding Optional methods is that second argument or value of supplier must be non-null otherwise Objects throws NPE: -CODE- . versus Optional: -CODE- . [1]Why haven't the JDK developers updated existing methods in Optional class? . [2]Why haven't they introduced a new method (which will thrown NPE if second argument is null) to Optional class?. [3]What should we use now Optional or Objects?. [4]Do new methods make Objects more preferable than Optional since they will throw NPE immediately and not later on somewhere in the code like with Optional?. If I have a legacy code, something like: -CODE- . Which is just a simple check inside a method. And I would like to re-factor it using latest language features. Now having in mind the difference between Optional.orElse and Objects.requireNonNullOrElse which is preferable? -CODE- . or : -CODE- .",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2464950,"and it looks very efficient, especially for enums with less than 64 values.",Enum.values() vs EnumSet.allOf( ). Which one is more preferable?,"I looked under the hood for EnumSet.allOf and it looks very efficient, especially for enums with less than 64 values. Basically all sets share the single array of all possible enum values and the only other piece of information is a bitmask which in case of allOf is set in one swoop. On the other hand Enum.values() seems to be a bit of black magic. Moreover it returns an array, not a collection, so in many cases it must be decorated with Arrays.asList( ) to be usable in any place that expects collection. So, should EnumSet.allOf be more preferable to Enum.values? More specifically, which form of for iterator should be used: -CODE- . or: -CODE- .",no

We can use Iterator to traverse a Set or a List or a Map. But ListIterator can only be used to traverse a List, it can't traverse a Set. Why? I know that the main difference is that with iterator we can travel in only one direction but with ListIterator we can travel both directions. Are there any other differences?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11051205,Currently the code seed's the Random once at startup.,Difference between java.util.Random and java.security.SecureRandom,"My team got handed over some server side code (in Java) that generates random tokens and I have a question regarding the same - The purpose of these tokens is fairly sensitive - used for session id, password reset links etc. So they do need to be cryptographically random to avoid somebody guessing them or brute force them feasibly. The token is a ""long"" so it is 64 bits long. The code currently uses the java.util.Random class to generate these tokens. The documentation ([http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html][1]) for java.util.Random clearly states the following: -CODE- . However, the way the code is currently using java.util.Random is this - It instantiates the java.security.SecureRandom class and then uses the SecureRandom.nextLong() method to obtain the seed that is used for instantiating the java.util.Randomclass. Then it uses java.util.Random.nextLong() method to generate the token. So my question now - Is it still insecure given that the java.util.Random is being seeded using java.security.SecureRandom?

[1]The output of the above code is 0 byte for the Direct Memory Usage (File.txt is 1 GB). But if I uncomment the line .. -CODE- . I get a Direct Memory Usage of 100MB . Not able to understand why is this so, as to why I am not getting any direct memory usage in the first place ( i.e. when the line is commented out ). [2]Although the Direct Memory Usage is 0 B for the above code, I do see that the resident memory ( using unix top ) of the process increase by 1 GB. But if I do a ""free -m"" on the box, I do not see any increase in memory usage.. In both the cases, I am a bit confused as to where the memory is ending up. Thanks!",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42482326,or : -CODE- .,java.util.Objects vs Optional which is preferable?,"The java.util.Objects class was extended with a number of new methods . Objects#requireNonNullElse . respectively. Objects#requireNonNullElseGet() in Java-9. Both will return the first argument if it is non-null and otherwise returns the non-null second argument or the non-null value of supplier.get() -CODE- . But the new functionality overlaps with already existing in the Optional class Optional#orElse and Optional#orElseGet: -CODE- . The only difference between new methods in Objects and corresponding Optional methods is that second argument or value of supplier must be non-null otherwise Objects throws NPE: -CODE- . versus Optional: -CODE- . [1]Why haven't the JDK developers updated existing methods in Optional class? . [2]Why haven't they introduced a new method (which will thrown NPE if second argument is null) to Optional class?. [3]What should we use now Optional or Objects?. [4]Do new methods make Objects more preferable than Optional since they will throw NPE immediately and not later on somewhere in the code like with Optional?. If I have a legacy code, something like: -CODE- . Which is just a simple check inside a method. And I would like to re-factor it using latest language features. Now having in mind the difference between Optional.orElse and Objects.requireNonNullOrElse which is preferable? -CODE- . or : -CODE- .",no

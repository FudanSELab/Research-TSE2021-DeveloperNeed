https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11815339,"Similarly when we want to load prototype bean, we will use same webapplication context to load it.",Role/Purpose of ContextLoaderListener in Spring?,"I am learning Spring Framework which is being used in my project. I found the ContextLoaderListener entry in my web.xml file. But could not figure out how exactly it helps a developer? In the official documentation of ContextLoaderListener it says it is to start WebApplicationContext. Regarding WebApplicationContext JavaDocs say: -CODE- . But I am not able to understand what I am achieving with ContextLoaderListener which internally initializes the WebApplicationContext ? As per my understanding, ContextLoaderListener reads the Spring configuration file (with value given against contextConfigLocation in web.xml), parses it and loads the singleton bean defined in that config file. Similarly when we want to load prototype bean, we will use same webapplication context to load it. So we initialize the webapplication with ContextLoaderListener so that we read/parse/validate the config file in advance and whenever we wan to inject dependency we can straightaway do it without any delay. Is this understanding correct?",no

Update: It turned out it's RequestFactory annotation process that fails. -CODE- . Any ideas on workarounds ? Update2: Perhaps it's not something readers want to hear but I ended up switching to Scala.,no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015813,These extends Observable and use setChanged() and notifyObservers() to trigger the views to update when appropriate.,"What goes into the ""Controller"" in ""MVC""?","I think I understand the basic concepts of MVC - the Model contains the data and behaviour of the application, the View is responsible for displaying it to the user and the Controller deals with user input. What I'm uncertain about is exactly what goes in the Controller. Lets say for example I have a fairly simple application (I'm specifically thinking Java, but I suppose the same principles apply elsewhere). I organise my code into 3 packages called app.model, app.view and app.controller. Within the app.model package, I have a few classes that reflect the actual behaviour of the application. These extends Observable and use setChanged() and notifyObservers() to trigger the views to update when appropriate. The app.view package has a class (or several classes for different types of display) that uses javax.swing components to handle the display. Some of these components need to feed back into the Model. If I understand correctly, the View shouldn't have anything to do with the feedback - that should be dealt with by the Controller. So what do I actually put in the Controller? Do I put the public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) in the View with just a call to a method in the Controller? If so, should any validation etc be done in the Controller? If so, how do I feedback error messages back to the View - should that go through the Model again, or should the Controller just send it straight back to View? If the validation is done in the View, what do I put in the Controller? Sorry for the long question, I just wanted to document my understanding of the process and hopefully someone can clarify this issue for me!",no

I organise my code into 3 packages called app.model, app.view and app.controller. Within the app.model package, I have a few classes that reflect the actual behaviour of the application. These extends Observable and use setChanged() and notifyObservers() to trigger the views to update when appropriate.

Do I put the public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) in the View with just a call to a method in the Controller? If so, should any validation etc be done in the Controller? If so, how do I feedback error messages back to the View - should that go through the Model again, or should the Controller just send it straight back to View?

PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy. Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class. For example, [1]/Vehicle/Car?registration=123.

There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. [1]Persistence. [2]Business. [3]Presentation. The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: -CODE- . Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. Persistence Performs create, read, update and delete (CRUD) persistence operations. In our case we are using (Java Persistence API) JPA and we currently use Hibernate as our persistence provider and use its EntityManager. This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager. In addition this layer also stores JPA entities which are things like Account, ShoppingCart etc. Business All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @Stateless to become a Stateless Session Bean (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called AccountManager. When AccountManager needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of AccountManagerPersistence, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in AccountManager could be: -CODE- . We use container manager transactions so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet. Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the Required transaction attribute for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's): -CODE- . Presentation Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old Servlet's + Java Server Pages (JSP) combination. The layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as String's and integers, and at other times JPA entities. Pros and cons with the architecture Pros [1]Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.. [2]It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.. [3]Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.. [4]Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.. [5]Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with load balancing and fail over. Both of which we feel that we must have.. Cons [1]Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @NamedQuery annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.. [2]We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But Account and ShoppingCart, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.. [3]The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (DTO's), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an anemic domain model as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.). [4]Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't purely Tomcat).. [5]There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.. [6]As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=FetchType.LAZY) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and do a FETCH JOIN. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome..",no

There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. [1]Persistence. [2]Business. [3]Presentation. The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: -CODE- .

The static import was of a method from a DA class, which has mostly static methods. So in middle of the business logic I had a da activity that apparently seemed to belong to the current class: -CODE- . The reviewer was not keen that I change the code and I didn't but I do kind of agree with him. One reason given for not static-importing was it was confusing where the method was defined, it wasn't in the current class and not in any superclass so it too some time to identify its definition (the web based review system does not have clickable links like IDE :-) I don't really think this matters, static-imports are still quite new and soon we will all get used to locating them. But the other reason, the one I agree with, is that an unqualified method call seems to belong to current object and should not jump contexts. But if it really did belong, it would make sense to extend that super class. So, when does it make sense to static import methods? When have you done it? Did/do you like the way the unqualified calls look? EDIT: The popular opinion seems to be that static-import methods if nobody is going to confuse them as methods of the current class.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3677380,"According to Steve's blog, postgresql wants you to use Streams for bytea (don't ask me why) and postgresql's custom Blob type for oids.",proper hibernate annotation for byte[],"I have an application using hibernate 3.1 and JPA annotations. It has a few objects with byte[] attributes (1k - 200k in size). It uses the JPA @Lob annotation, and hibernate 3.1 can read these just fine on all major databases -- it seems to hide the JDBC Blob vendor peculiarities (as it should do). -CODE- . We had to upgrade to 3.5, when we discovered that hibernate 3.5 breaks (and won't fix) this annotation combination in postgresql (with no workaround). I have not found a clear fix so far, but I did notice that if I just remove the @Lob, it uses the postgresql type bytea (which works, but only on postgres). -CODE- . I am looking for a way to have a single annotated class (with a blob property) which is portable across major databases. [1]What is the portable way to annotate a byte[] property?. [2]Is this fixed in some recent version of hibernate?. Update: After reading this blog I have finally figured out what the original workaround in the JIRA issue was: Apparently you are supposed to drop @Lob and annotate the property as: -CODE- . However, this does not work for me -- I still get OIDs instead of bytea; it did however work for the author of the JIRA issue, who seemed to want oid. After the answer from A. Garcia, I then tried this combo, which actually does work on postgresql, but not on oracle. -CODE- . What I really need to do is control which @org.hibernate.annotations.Type the combination (@Lob + byte[] gets mapped) to (on postgresql). Here is the snippet from 3.5.5.Final from MaterializedBlobType (sql type Blob). According to Steve's blog, postgresql wants you to use Streams for bytea (don't ask me why) and postgresql's custom Blob type for oids. Note also that using setBytes() on JDBC is also for bytea (from past experience). So this explains why use-streams has no affect they both assume 'bytea'. -CODE- . This results in: -CODE- . Update The next logical question is: ""why not just change the table definitions manually to bytea"" and keep the (@Lob + byte[])? This does work, UNTIL you try to store a null byte[]. Which the postgreSQL driver thinks is an OID type expression and the column type is bytea -- this is because hibernate (rightly) calls JDBC.setNull() instead of JDBC.setBytes(null) which PG driver expects. -CODE- . The type system in hibernate is currently a 'work in progress' (according to 3.5.5 deprecation comment). In fact so much of the 3.5.5 code is deprecated, it is hard to know what to look at when sub-classing the PostgreSQLDialect). AFAKT, Types.BLOB/'oid' on postgresql should be mapped to some custom type which uses OID style JDBC access (i.e. PostgresqlBlobType object and NOT MaterializedBlobType). I've never actually successfully used Blobs with postgresql, but I do know that bytea just simply works as one / I would expect. I am currently looking at the BatchUpdateException -- its possible that the driver doesn't support batching.

I accept the answer below, but here's an alternate take by Martin Fowler who discusses the merits of Dependency Injection vs. using a Service Locator (which is essentially the same as calling a wrapped ApplicationContext.getBean()). In part, Fowler states, ""With service locator the application class asks for it [the service] explicitly by a message to the locator. With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears in the application class - hence the inversion of control. Inversion of control is a common feature of frameworks, but it's something that comes at a price. It tends to be hard to understand and leads to problems when you are trying to debug. So on the whole I prefer to avoid it [Inversion of Control] unless I need it. This isn't to say it's a bad thing, just that I think it needs to justify itself over the more straightforward alternative.""",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15621083,the 18 to 28 case range than it is from 11 up to 17?,Why does Java switch on contiguous ints appear to run faster with added cases?,"I am working on some Java code which needs to be highly optimized as it will run in hot functions that are invoked at many points in my main program logic. Part of this code involves multiplying double variables by 10 raised to arbitrary non-negative int exponents. One fast way (edit: but not the fastest possible, see Update 2 below) to get the multiplied value is to switch on the exponent: -CODE- . The commented ellipses above indicate that the case int constants continue incrementing by 1, so there are really 19 cases in the above code snippet. Since I wasn't sure whether I would actually need all the powers of 10 in case statements 10 thru 18, I ran some microbenchmarks comparing the time to complete 10 million operations with this switch statement versus a switch with only cases 0 thru 9 (with the exponent limited to 9 or less to avoid breaking the pared-down switch). I got the rather surprising (to me, at least!) result that the longer switch with more case statements actually ran faster. On a lark, I tried adding even more cases which just returned dummy values, and found that I could get the switch to run even faster with around 22-27 declared cases (even though those dummy cases are never actually hit while the code is running). (Again, cases were added in a contiguous fashion by incrementing the prior case constant by 1.) These execution time differences are not very significant: for a random exponent between 0 and 10, the dummy padded switch statement finishes 10 million executions in 1.49 secs versus 1.54 secs for the unpadded version, for a grand total savings of 5ns per execution. So, not the kind of thing that makes obsessing over padding out a switch statement worth the effort from an optimization standpoint. But I still just find it curious and counter-intuitive that a switch doesn't become slower (or perhaps at best maintain constant O(1) time) to execute as more cases are added to it. These are the results I obtained from running with various limits on the randomly-generated exponent values. I didn't include the results all the way down to 1 for the exponent limit, but the general shape of the curve remains the same, with a ridge around the 12-17 case mark, and a valley between 18-28. All tests were run in JUnitBenchmarks using shared containers for the random values to ensure identical testing inputs. I also ran the tests both in order from longest switch statement to shortest, and vice-versa, to try and eliminate the possibility of ordering-related test problems. I've put my testing code up on a github repo if anyone wants to try to reproduce these results. So, what's going on here? Some vagaries of my architecture or micro-benchmark construction? Or is the Java switch really a little faster to execute in the 18 to 28 case range than it is from 11 up to 17? github test repo ""switch-experiment"" UPDATE: I cleaned up the benchmarking library quite a bit and added a text file in /results with some output across a wider range of possible exponent values. I also added an option in the testing code not to throw an Exception from default, but this doesn't appear to affect the results. UPDATE 2: Found some pretty good discussion of this issue from back in 2009 on the xkcd forum here: http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=33524. The OP's discussion of using Array.binarySearch() gave me the idea for a simple array-based implementation of the exponentiation pattern above. There's no need for the binary search since I know what the entries in the array are. It appears to run about 3 times faster than using switch, obviously at the expense of some of the control flow that switch affords. That code has been added to the github repo also.",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/286846,"In addition this layer also stores JPA entities which are things like Account, ShoppingCart etc.",Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?,"Let's share Java based web application architectures! There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. [1]Persistence. [2]Business. [3]Presentation. The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: -CODE- . Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. Persistence Performs create, read, update and delete (CRUD) persistence operations. In our case we are using (Java Persistence API) JPA and we currently use Hibernate as our persistence provider and use its EntityManager. This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager. In addition this layer also stores JPA entities which are things like Account, ShoppingCart etc. Business All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @Stateless to become a Stateless Session Bean (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called AccountManager. When AccountManager needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of AccountManagerPersistence, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in AccountManager could be: -CODE- . We use container manager transactions so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet. Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the Required transaction attribute for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's): -CODE- . Presentation Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old Servlet's + Java Server Pages (JSP) combination. The layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as String's and integers, and at other times JPA entities. Pros and cons with the architecture Pros [1]Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.. [2]It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.. [3]Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.. [4]Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.. [5]Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with load balancing and fail over. Both of which we feel that we must have.. Cons [1]Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @NamedQuery annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.. [2]We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But Account and ShoppingCart, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.. [3]The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (DTO's), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an anemic domain model as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.). [4]Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't purely Tomcat).. [5]There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.. [6]As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=FetchType.LAZY) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and do a FETCH JOIN. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome..",no

I would like it to throw an error if there are multiple matches, though. Is there a way to do this?",no

[2]somehow make gradle NOT compile the projLib explicitly. The problem is, I couldn't find how to do any of that. Would be awesome if you guys can help :)",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2248131,"The output from this program is ""Everything's fine--situation normal!""",Handling exceptions from Java ExecutorService tasks,"I'm trying to use Java's ThreadPoolExecutor class to run a large number of heavy weight tasks with a fixed number of threads. Each of the tasks has many places during which it may fail due to exceptions. I've subclassed ThreadPoolExecutor and I've overridden the afterExecute method which is supposed to provide any uncaught exceptions encountered while running a task. However, I can't seem to make it work. For example: -CODE- . The output from this program is ""Everything's fine--situation normal!"" even though the only Runnable submitted to the thread pool throws an exception. Any clue to what's going on here? Thanks!",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552301,Does this mean that two objects are created again,Immutability of Strings in Java,"Consider the following example. -CODE- . Now, in Java, String objects are immutable. Then how come the object str can be assigned value ""Help!"". Isn't this contradicting the immutability of strings in Java? Can anybody please explain me the exact concept of immutability? Edit: Ok. I am now getting it, but just one follow-up question. What about the following code: -CODE- . Does this mean that two objects are created again (""Mississippi"" and ""M!ss!ss!pp!"") and the reference str points to a different object after replace() method?",no
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/561245,Can this be changed?,"Virtual Memory Usage from Java under Linux, too much memory used","I have a problem with a Java application running under Linux. When I launch the application, using the default maximum heap size (64 MB), I see using the tops application that 240 MB of virtual Memory are allocated to the application. This creates some issues with some other software on the computer, which is relatively resource-limited. The reserved virtual memory will not be used anyway, as far as I understand, because once we reach the heap limit an OutOfMemoryError is thrown. I ran the same application under windows and I see that the Virtual Memory size and the Heap size are similar. Is there anyway that I can configure the Virtual Memory in use for a Java process under Linux? Edit 1: The problem is not the Heap. The problem is that if I set a Heap of 128 MB, for example, still Linux allocates 210 MB of Virtual Memory, which is not needed, ever.** Edit 2: Using ulimit -v allows limiting the amount of virtual memory. If the size set is below 204 MB, then the application won't run even though it doesn't need 204 MB, only 64 MB. So I want to understand why Java requires so much virtual memory. Can this be changed? Edit 3: There are several other applications running in the system, which is embedded. And the system does have a virtual memory limit (from comments, important detail).",no

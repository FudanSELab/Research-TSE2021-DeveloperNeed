https://stackoverflow.com/questions/141993,Best way to compare 2 XML documents in Java,Best way to compare 2 XML documents in Java,"I'm trying to write an automated test of an application that basically translates a custom message change_data_into_doccano_format into an XML message and sends it out the other end. I've got a good set of input/output message pairs so all I need to do is send the input messages in and listen for the XML message to come out the other end. When it comes time to compare the actual output to the expected output I'm running into some problems. My first thought was just to do string comparisons on the expected and actual messages. This doens't work very well because the example data we have isn't always formatted consistently and there are often times different aliases used for the XML namespace (and sometimes namespaces aren't used at all.) I know I can parse both strings and then walk through each element and compare them myself and this wouldn't be too difficult to do, but I get the feeling there's a better way or a library I could leverage. So, boiled down, the question is: Given two Java Strings which both contain valid XML how would you go about determining if they are semantically equivalent? Bonus points if you have a way to determine what the differences are.",no

If you have a method T myDefault() why wouldn't you just do optional.orElse(myDefault()) rather than optional.orElseGet(() -> myDefault()) ?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13239972,How do you implement a re-try-catch?,How do you implement a re-try-catch?,"Try-catch is meant to help in the exception handling. This means somehow that it will help our system to be more robust: try to recover from an unexpected event. We suspect something might happen when executing and instruction (sending a message), so it gets enclosed in the try. If that something nearly unexpected happens, we can do something: we write the catch. I don't think we called to just log the exception. I thing the catch block is meant to give us the opportunity of recovering from the error. Now, let's say we recover from the error because we could fix what was wrong. It could be super nice to do a re-try: -CODE- . This would quickly fall in the eternal loop, but let's say that the fix_the_problem returns true, then we retry.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/286846,We use container manager transactions,Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?,"Let's share Java based web application architectures! There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. [1]Persistence. [2]Business. [3]Presentation. The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: -CODE- . Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. Persistence Performs create, read, update and delete (CRUD) persistence operations. In our case we are using (Java Persistence API) JPA and we currently use Hibernate as our persistence provider and use its EntityManager. This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager. In addition this layer also stores JPA entities which are things like Account, ShoppingCart etc. Business All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @Stateless to become a Stateless Session Bean (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called AccountManager. When AccountManager needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of AccountManagerPersistence, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in AccountManager could be: -CODE- . We use container manager transactions so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet. Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the Required transaction attribute for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's): -CODE- . Presentation Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old Servlet's + Java Server Pages (JSP) combination. The layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as String's and integers, and at other times JPA entities. Pros and cons with the architecture Pros [1]Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.. [2]It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.. [3]Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.. [4]Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.. [5]Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with load balancing and fail over. Both of which we feel that we must have.. Cons [1]Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @NamedQuery annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.. [2]We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But Account and ShoppingCart, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.. [3]The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (DTO's), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an anemic domain model as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.). [4]Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't purely Tomcat).. [5]There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.. [6]As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=FetchType.LAZY) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and do a FETCH JOIN. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome..",no

What I can think of that the decision might be using the two to differentiate the information pattern. Let me illustrate below my LTPO - less than perfect observation. PathParam use could be reserved for information category, which would fall nicely into a branch of an information tree. PathParam could be used to drill down to entity class hierarchy. Whereas, QueryParam could be reserved for specifying attributes to locate the instance of a class. For example, [1]/Vehicle/Car?registration=123.

Therefore I was looking for some background information how Camel is different from Spring Integration, but it seems like information out there are pretty spare, I found: [1]http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-integration-and-apache (Very neutral comparison between implementing a real-world integration scenario in Spring Integration vs. Camel, from December 2009).

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/286846,and we currently use Hibernate as our persistence provider and use its EntityManager.,Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?,"Let's share Java based web application architectures! There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. [1]Persistence. [2]Business. [3]Presentation. The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: -CODE- . Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. Persistence Performs create, read, update and delete (CRUD) persistence operations. In our case we are using (Java Persistence API) JPA and we currently use Hibernate as our persistence provider and use its EntityManager. This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager. In addition this layer also stores JPA entities which are things like Account, ShoppingCart etc. Business All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @Stateless to become a Stateless Session Bean (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called AccountManager. When AccountManager needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of AccountManagerPersistence, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in AccountManager could be: -CODE- . We use container manager transactions so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet. Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the Required transaction attribute for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's): -CODE- . Presentation Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old Servlet's + Java Server Pages (JSP) combination. The layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as String's and integers, and at other times JPA entities. Pros and cons with the architecture Pros [1]Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.. [2]It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.. [3]Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.. [4]Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.. [5]Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with load balancing and fail over. Both of which we feel that we must have.. Cons [1]Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @NamedQuery annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.. [2]We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But Account and ShoppingCart, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.. [3]The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (DTO's), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an anemic domain model as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.). [4]Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't purely Tomcat).. [5]There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.. [6]As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=FetchType.LAZY) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and do a FETCH JOIN. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome..",no

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2635839,JUnit confusion: use 'extends TestCase' or '@Test'?,JUnit confusion: use 'extends TestCase' or '@Test'?,"I've found the proper use (or at least the documentation) of JUnit very confusing. This question serves both as a future reference and as a real question. If I've understood correctly, there are two main approaches to create and run a JUnit test: Approach A (JUnit 3-style): create a class that extends TestCase, and start test methods with the word test. When running the class as a JUnit Test (in Eclipse), all methods starting with the word test are automatically run. -CODE- . Approach B (JUnit 4-style): create a 'normal' class and prepend a @Test annotation to the method. Note that you do NOT have to start the method with the word test. -CODE- . Mixing the two seems not to be a good idea, see e.g. this stackoverflow question: Now, my questions(s): [1]What is the preferred approach, or when would you use one instead of the other?. [2]Approach B allows for testing for exceptions by extending the @Test annotation like in @Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class). But how do you test for exceptions when using approach A?. [3]When using approach A, you can group a number of test classes in a test suite like this: TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(""All tests""); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestA.class); suite.addTestSuite(DummyTestAbis.class); But this can't be used with approach B (since each testclass should subclass TestCase). What is the proper way to group tests for approach B?. Edit: I've added the JUnit versions to both approaches.",yes

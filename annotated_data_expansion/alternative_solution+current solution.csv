I profiled the view and noticed that there was one query executed by hibernate which took 10 seconds even if there only were two object in the database to fetch. All OneToMany and ManyToMany relations were lazy so that wasn't the problem. When inspecting the actual SQL being executed, I noticed that there were over 80 joins in the query. Further inspecting the issue, I noticed that the problem was caused by the deep hierarchy of OneToOne and ManyToOne relations between entity classes. So, I thought, I'll just make them fetched lazy, that should solve the problem. But annotating either @OneToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) or @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) doesn't seem to work. Either I get an exception or then they are not actually replaced with a proxy object and thus being lazy. Any ideas how I'll get this to work?

What I'm uncertain about is exactly what goes in the Controller. Lets say for example I have a fairly simple application (I'm specifically thinking Java, but I suppose the same principles apply elsewhere). I organise my code into 3 packages called app.model, app.view and app.controller. Within the app.model package, I have a few classes that reflect the actual behaviour of the application. These extends Observable and use setChanged() and notifyObservers() to trigger the views to update when appropriate. The app.view package has a class (or several classes for different types of display) that uses javax.swing components to handle the display. Some of these components need to feed back into the Model. If I understand correctly, the View shouldn't have anything to do with the feedback - that should be dealt with by the Controller. So what do I actually put in the Controller? Do I put the public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) in the View with just a call to a method in the Controller? If so, should any validation etc be done in the Controller? If so, how do I feedback error messages back to the View - should that go through the Model again, or should the Controller just send it straight back to View? If the validation is done in the View, what do I put in the Controller? Sorry for the long question, I just wanted to document my understanding of the process and hopefully someone can clarify this issue for me!",no

I can set up my application to use the file as either. -CODE- . and with System.setProperty( ""javax.net.debug"", ""ssl"") set, I can see the certificate under trusted certifications (but not under the keystore section). The particular certificate I'm importing has only a public key and I intend to use it to send stuff over an SSL connection to Bob (but perhaps that's best left for another question!). Any pointers or clarifications would be much appreciated. Is the output of keytool the same whatever you import and its just convention that says one is a keystore and the other a trust store? What's the relationship when using SSL etc?",no

We're going to start altering our working practices to mitigate the problem, including a greater emphasis on the hosted-mode browser, which defers the need to run the GWT compiler until a later time, but that brings its own risks, particularly that of not catching issues with real browsers until much later than we'd like. Ideally, we'd like to make the GWT compiler itself quicker - a minute to compile a fairly small application is taking the piss. However, we are using the compile if a fairly naive fashion, so I'm hoping we can make some quick and easy gains. We're currently invoking com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler as a java application from ant Ant target, with 256m max heap and lots of stack space. The compiler is launched by Ant using fork=true and the latest Java 6 JRE, to try and take advantage of Java6's improved performance. We pass our main controller class to the compiler along with the application classpath, and off it goes. What else can we do to get some extra speed? Can we give it more information so it spends less time doing discovery of what to do? I know we can tell it to only compile for one browser, but we need to do multi-browser testing, so that's not really practical. All suggestions welcome at this point.",no

I am not able to decrypt a string generated using java using this PHP. Update. here is the text and key that i tried for encryption using the above java code: -CODE- .,no

I'm building the tokenizing portion of a small parser with help of the book Building Parsers with Java.

I want to mock one of the methods of the implementation of interf out so that it does something specific, but only later on in the test case, e.g. if I was dealing with classes rather than interfaces I'd use: -CODE- . which works fine if I know what someRealClass will return, but if I replace ""ConcreteClassOfIAmAnInterface"" with ""IAmAnInterface"" then the method isn't mocked. If I were to use Mockito I would do something like: -CODE- . Is there a nice way/any way to do this in JMockit?",no

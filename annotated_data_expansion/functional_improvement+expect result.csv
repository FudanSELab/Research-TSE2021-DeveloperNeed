Java compile speed vs Scala compile speed	"I've been programming in Scala for a while and I like it but one thing I'm annoyed by is the time it takes to compile programs. It's seems like a small thing but with Java I could make small changes to my program, click the run button in netbeans, and BOOM, it's running, and over time compiling in scala seems to consume a lot of time. I hear that with many large projects a scripting language becomes very important because of the time compiling takes, a need that I didn't see arising when I was using Java. But I'm coming from Java which as I understand it, is faster than any other compiled language, and is fast because of the reasons I switched to Scala(It's a very simple language).

Effect of a Bitwise Operator on a Boolean in Java	"The bitwise operators are supposed to travel variables and operate on them bit by bit. In the case of integers, longs, chars this makes sense. These variables can contain the full range of values enforced by their size. In the case of booleans, however, a boolean can contain only two values. 1 = true or 0 = false. But the size of the boolean isn't defined. It can be as big as a byte or as small a bit. So what's the effect of using a bitwise operator on a boolean? Does the JVM essentially translate it to a normal logical operator and move on? Does it treat the boolean as a single bit entity for the purpose of the operation? Or is the result undefined along with the size of a boolean?"	no

How do I use Java to read from a file that is actively being written to?	"I have an application that writes information to file. This information is used post-execution to determine pass/failure/correctness of the application. I'd like to be able to read the file as it is being written so that I can do these pass/failure/correctness checks in real time. I assume it is possible to do this, but what are the gotcha's involved when using Java? If the reading catches up to the writing, will it just wait for more writes up until the file is closed, or will the read throw an exception at this point? If the latter, what do I do then?

"We have to build Strings all the time for log output and so on. Over the JDK versions we have learned when to use StringBuffer (many appends, thread safe) and StringBuilder (many appends, non-thread-safe). What's the advice on using String.format()? Is it efficient, or are we forced to stick with concatenation for one-liners where performance is important? e.g. ugly old style, -CODE- . vs. tidy new style (and possibly slow), -CODE- . Note: my specific use case is the hundreds of 'one-liner' log strings throughout my code. They don't involve a loop, so StringBuilder is too heavyweight. I'm interested in String.format() specifically."	no

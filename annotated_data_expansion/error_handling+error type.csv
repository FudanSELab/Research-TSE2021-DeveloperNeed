https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27416834,-CODE- .,App crashing when trying to use RecyclerView on android 5.0,"I'm trying to mess with the new RecyclerView and whenever I try to run it, my app immediately crashes. It gives me NullPointerException for trying to access methods from android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView. I've looked at other posts and saw that most people didn't have compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:+' but I tried that and it hasn't helped at all. Not really sure what to do at this point, any help would be appreciated. Here the error log: (I would post a picture but I don't have 10 rep yet) java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$LayoutManager.onMeasure(android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler, android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$State, int, int)' on a null object reference at android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.onMeasure(RecyclerView.java:1764) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.widget.RelativeLayout.measureChildHorizontal(RelativeLayout.java:727) at android.widget.RelativeLayout.onMeasure(RelativeLayout.java:463) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureChildBeforeLayout(LinearLayout.java:1436) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureVertical(LinearLayout.java:722) at android.widget.LinearLayout.onMeasure(LinearLayout.java:613) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout.onMeasure(DrawerLayout.java:851) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureChildBeforeLayout(LinearLayout.java:1436) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureVertical(LinearLayout.java:722) at android.widget.LinearLayout.onMeasure(LinearLayout.java:613) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureChildBeforeLayout(LinearLayout.java:1436) at android.widget.LinearLayout.measureVertical(LinearLayout.java:722) at android.widget.LinearLayout.onMeasure(LinearLayout.java:613) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewGroup.measureChildWithMargins(ViewGroup.java:5463) at android.widget.FrameLayout.onMeasure(FrameLayout.java:430) at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView.onMeasure(PhoneWindow.java:2560) at android.view.View.measure(View.java:17430) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.performMeasure(ViewRootImpl.java:2001) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.measureHierarchy(ViewRootImpl.java:1166) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.performTraversals(ViewRootImpl.java:1372) at android.view.ViewRootImpl.doTraversal(ViewRootImpl.java:1054) at android.view.ViewRootImpl$TraversalRunnable.run(ViewRootImpl.java:5786) at android.view.Choreographer$CallbackRecord.run(Choreographer.java:767) at android.view.Choreographer.doCallbacks(Choreographer.java:580) at android.view.Choreographer.doFrame(Choreographer.java:550) at android.view.Choreographer$FrameDisplayEventReceiver.run(Choreographer.java:753) at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:739) at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95) at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:135) at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5221) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:372) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:898) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:693)",yes

Then a friend suggested me to always test the session and get the current session to avoid this error. So i did this: public static Model getModelByModelGroup(int modelGroupId) { Session session = null; boolean openSession = session == null; Transaction tx = null; if (openSession){ session = SessionFactoryHelper.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession(); tx = session.getTransaction(); } String responseMessage = """"; try { if (openSession) tx.begin(); Query query = session.createQuery(""from Model where modelGroup.id = :modelGroupId""); query.setParameter(""modelGroupId"", modelGroupId); @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") List<Model> modelList = (List<Model>)query.list(); Model model = null; for (Model m : modelList) if (m.getModelType().getId() == 3) { model = m; break; } if (model == null) { Object[] arrModels = modelList.toArray(); if (arrModels.length == 0) throw new RuntimeException(""Non esiste""); model = (Model)arrModels[0]; if (openSession) tx.commit(); return model; } catch(RuntimeException ex) { if (openSession) tx.rollback(); ex.printStackTrace(); if (responseMessage.compareTo("""") == 0) responseMessage = ""Error"" + ex.getMessage(); return null; } } but still get the same error. I have been reading a lot for this error and found some possible solutions. One of them was to set lazyLoad to false but I am not allowed to do this thats why i was suggested to control the session.",no

I have been reading a lot for this error and found some possible solutions. One of them was to set lazyLoad to false but I am not allowed to do this thats why i was suggested to control the session.",yes

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6690745,or: -CODE- .,Converting Integer to Long,"I need to get the value of a field using reflection. It so happens that I am not always sure what the datatype of the field is. For that, and to avoid some code duplication I have created the following method: @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") private static <T> T getValueByReflection(VarInfo var, Class<?> classUnderTest, Object runtimeInstance) throws Throwable { Field f = classUnderTest.getDeclaredField(processFieldName(var)); f.setAccessible(true); T value = (T) f.get(runtimeInstance); return value; } And use this method like: Long value1 = getValueByReflection(inv.var1(), classUnderTest, runtimeInstance); or. Double[] value2 = getValueByReflection(inv.var2(), classUnderTest, runtimeInstance); The problem is that I can't seem to cast Integer to Long: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long Is there a better way to achieve this?

All instructions to fix this problem assume I'm fully proficient with keytool, such as . generate private key for server and import it into keystore. Is there anybody who could post detailed instructions? I'm running unix, so bash script would be best. Not sure if it's important, but code executed in jboss.",no

Given that the cache will be used in a multithreaded environment, which datastructures would you use? I've already implemented one using LinkedHashMap and Collections#synchronizedMap, but I'm curious if any of the new concurrent collections would be better candidates. UPDATE: I was just reading through Yegge's latest when I found this nugget: -CODE- . I was thinking almost exactly the same thing before I went with the LinkedHashMap + Collections#synchronizedMap implementation I mentioned above. Nice to know I hadn't just overlooked something. Based on the answers so far, it sounds like my best bet for a highly concurrent LRU would be to extend ConcurrentHashMap using some of the same logic that LinkedHashMap uses.",yes

I have a piece of code that opens a file using a hard-coded relative file path from the directory it's normally started in, and I just want to be able to use that code from within a different Java program without having to start it from within a particular directory. It seems like you should just be able to call System.setProperty( ""user.dir"", ""/path/to/dir"" ), but as far as I can figure out, calling that line just silently fails and does nothing. I would understand if Java didn't allow you to do this, if it weren't for the fact that it allows you to get the current working directory, and even allows you to open files using relative file paths....",yes

The simplest method of having a parent pom would be putting it in the root of a project i.e. -CODE- . where the pom.xml is both the parent project as well as describes the -core -api and -app modules. The next method is to separate out the parent into its own subdirectory as in: -CODE- . Where the parent pom still contains the modules but they're relative, e.g. ../myproject-core. Finally, there's the option where the module definition and the parent are separated as in: -CODE- . Where the parent pom contains any ""shared"" configuration (dependencyManagement, properties etc.) and the myproject/pom.xml contains the list of modules.

We're going to start altering our working practices to mitigate the problem, including a greater emphasis on the hosted-mode browser, which defers the need to run the GWT compiler until a later time, but that brings its own risks, particularly that of not catching issues with real browsers until much later than we'd like. Ideally, we'd like to make the GWT compiler itself quicker - a minute to compile a fairly small application is taking the piss.

We're currently invoking com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler as a java application from ant Ant target, with 256m max heap and lots of stack space.

Can we give it more information so it spends less time doing discovery of what to do?

When I launch the application, using the default maximum heap size (64 MB), I see using the tops application that 240 MB of virtual Memory are allocated to the application. This creates some issues with some other software on the computer, which is relatively resource-limited. The reserved virtual memory will not be used anyway, as far as I understand, because once we reach the heap limit an OutOfMemoryError is thrown. I ran the same application under windows and I see that the Virtual Memory size and the Heap size are similar. Is there anyway that I can configure the Virtual Memory in use for a Java process under Linux? Edit 1: The problem is not the Heap. The problem is that if I set a Heap of 128 MB, for example, still Linux allocates 210 MB of Virtual Memory, which is not needed, ever.** Edit 2: Using ulimit -v allows limiting the amount of virtual memory. If the size set is below 204 MB, then the application won't run even though it doesn't need 204 MB, only 64 MB. So I want to understand why Java requires so much virtual memory. Can this be changed? Edit 3: There are several other applications running in the system, which is embedded. And the system does have a virtual memory limit (from comments, important detail).",no

449,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22307516,Additionally I've checked that there are no duplicate JAVA_HOME definitions in .bash_profile or /etc/profile.,Gradle finds wrong JAVA_HOME even though it's correctly set,"When trying to run gradle, I get the following error: -CODE- . However, when I check the JAVA_HOME variable I get: -CODE- . My JAVA_HOME is defined in .bashrc and I have double checked that it is set as the source. Running java -version also confirms that JAVA_HOME is set correctly and is on the PATH. -CODE- . I have also checked that /usr/bin/java symlinks to /etc/alternatives/java which in turn correctly symlinks to /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java. Additionally I've checked that there are no duplicate JAVA_HOME definitions in .bash_profile or /etc/profile. So my question is how/why does Gradle find /usr/lib/jvm/default-java, and more importantly how do I point it to the correct directory? Other programs which require the JDK work fine, so I think its a Gradle issue. I've also tried reinstalling Gradle which made no difference. I'm running 64bit Xubuntu (Ubuntu 13.10 base)",no

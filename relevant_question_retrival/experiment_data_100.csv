UPDATE: Since more detailed explanation was requested, I'm doing that. So, recently I was helping out some fellow Java developer and noticed he is using Eclipse w/o Sun's JDK. Since company-wide we are using only Sun's JDKs, I found it rather strange. It appeared that he has only Eclipse and no additional tools for compiling java code (like javac) are required. This is because Eclipse comes bundled with its own compiler (check this for more details). By itself I find this feature quite nice, and I believe there were good reasons for that. But I would like all our company developers to use same compiler to generate java bytecode (.class files). And to run this in same JVMs. Just for sake of having as unified environment as possible and eliminating additional environment-specific issues. I have no problem with specifying JRE in Eclipse.

A simple explanation of the Leibniz method can be found here (method 3).

Esentially, It starts with the fraction 4/n where n = 1, and alternates between subtracting and adding the fraction 4/n, incrementing n to the next odd integer each iteration.

The program outputs simply 5, no matter how many decimal places are specified.

My code:

public static void calculatePi(int decimals) {
    BigDecimal pi = new BigDecimal(0.0);
    pi.setScale(decimals); // Set how many decimal points to use.
    boolean plus = true; // Add on the next iteration?
    int denominator = 1;
    BigDecimal nextVal = new BigDecimal((4/denominator));

    for(int i=0; i<decimals; i++)

        if(plus == true) {
            pi = pi.add(nextVal);
        } else {

To overcome this I have a separate jPanel called DLogCover which sizes with the window but which is invisible until required. When the custom dialog is shown a screenshot of my window is taken and shown as an image in a label on the DLogCover, which appears beneath my custom dialog, but above everything else (On the MODAL_LAYER of a jLayeredPanel - the custom dialog appears on the POPUP_LAYER). This works exactly as planned although there are two niggling points which I hope you may be able to help with. Firstly the screenshot of course includes the title bar and left border of the window. I have taken this into account using arbitrary numbers which work for me right now, but of course this will be different on every OS because I use the system Look and feel and these sizes might be incorrect. Question: Is there any way to make sure that my screenshot is only of the inner content of my window (or any way to always get the correct sizes for the title bar and borders of the window, regardless of OS)? Secondly, while my screenshot works fine it is simply an image of the window, and I would like to have it slightly faded or blurred in order to make it appear that there is in fact something covering the controls. Question: Is there any way to manipulate an image to give this appearance? Here is the code I am using to capture the image and display it (before showing the custom dialog): -CODE- . Many thanks for any help you can give, and as before, the reason I am doing things this way is because I am trying to learn Java so I am experimenting, and currently it is with this! Many thanks for any help you can give, and of course I am open to suggestions about alternative methods for achieving the same thing. Some Answers Id like to add this information so that any others who come looking can find the it. Thanks to Andrew Thompson's code (many thanks to nIcE cOw for the link) I can now get a screenshot of just my window contents, negating the need to try and work out titlebar and border sizes: -CODE- . This is called when I open my custom dialog and I am then able to modify the image to darken and blur it a little then display it in a jLabel which exists on my custom DLogCover (which is just a jPanel and a jLabel for the image): -CODE- . I then need to prevent mouse and key events from interacting with the controls on the main window, which are still accessible at the moment, even though they are hidden by the image. I am trying to do this with the following code, but this seems to block only the mouse events: -CODE- . Iv tried various controls in place of the jLabel but with the same effect: The mouse is blocked but the keys are not. This is something of a problem because one of the main elements in the app is a jTextPane which absolutely must not be allowed to accept extraneous key inputs. For simplicity at the moment I am turning the editable property on and off as required to prevent accidental typing into the text pane, but this is very much a workaround hack because at some point I might have keyboard accelerators assigned and I don't want them being activated by accident when the custom dialog is open. If anyone has any further suggestions to prevent any keyboard events reaching the underlying controls while the custom dialog is open Id very much like to hear them. regards. MVK. ",1

96,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6531272,"""En dash"" being garbled during http response handling or text manipulation","I'm writing code to work with text from Wikipedia and am having issues with en dashes being garbled. I haven't worked with en dashes or other non-standard characters before (non-standard to me being character that don't appear on my keyboard ;), so I'm not sure where to point the finger at what I'm doing wrong. Here's what is happening, along with code snippets..... I send a request to Wikipedia (I'm using the Apache HttpComponents client API for communicating with Wikipedia) for the contents of an article and save it in a String: -CODE- . At this point if I were to send ""responseBody"" to System.out, en dashes are displayed in my Eclipse console as '?'. This might just be an Eclipse console display issue so I'll move on. I manipulate the text, ignoring the en dashes, and then send the text back to Wikipedia. -CODE- . When the text, now uploaded to Wikipedia, is displayed in a web browser what was en dashes before are now displayed as '?' in a box (unknown character?). Therefore, somewhere I am inadvertently changing or miscoding the en dashes, but I'm not sure exactly where. Can someone point me in the right direction? ",1

The goal was to start an animation if I hover over a certain button. That was easy. But the problem is, I want to manipulate the speed of the timer of the animation according to the coordinates of the button. For example, the more right I go on the button the more speedy the animation gets (delay time decreases) and vice-versa. The code I wrote works if I move the arrow out of the button then enter again. Then the delay changes according to co-ordinates. But not if I move the arrow within the region of the button. I used mouseEntered here. That may cause cause the problem. But the mouseMove function seems not to work too. Here's my code: -CODE- . ",1
99,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2803004,Java EE Website Planning Questions,"I'm a .NET programmer who is soon moving to the Java EE world. I have plenty of experience with .NET web technologies, web services, WebForms and MVC. I am also very familiar with the Java language, and have written a few servlets and modified a couple of JSP pages, but I haven't touched EE yet. I'd like to set up a public website using Java EE so I can familiarize myself with whats current. I'm thinking just a technology playground at this point with no particular purpose in mind. What Java technologies are the current hotness for this sort of thing? (For example, if someone asked me what I'd recommend learning to set up a new .NET site, I'd say use ASP MVC instead of WebForms and recommend LINQ-to-SQL as a quick, simple and widely used ORM.) So, what I'd like to know is: [1]Is there a recommended technology for the presentation layer? Is JSP considered a good approach, or is there anything cleaner/newer/more widespread?. [2]Is Hibernate still widely used for persistence? Is it obsolete? Is there anything better out there? (I've worked with NHibernate some, so I wouldn't be starting from scratch.). [3]Is cheap Java EE web hosting available?. [4]What should I know being a .NET web developer moving to the Java world?. ",0
